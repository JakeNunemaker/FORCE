CA01,NaiKun - Haida Energy Field ,,Canada,Approved,,British Columbia,"The proposed site is a 100km2 area within the total 550km2 area covered by an Investigative licence.  The licence also includes two transmission corridors that would connect the NaiKun Wind Project to Haida Gwaii (currently off-grid and on diesel generation) and the mainland power grid, and includes the license of occupancy for the Met Mast.     Considered an attractive site: Annual wind speeds exceed 10.0 meters/second ,The wind is the strongest and most consistent in the fall and winter when electricity demand is the highest ; flat sedimentary seabed, relatively shallow waters, access to BC Hydro’s power grid, and its proximity to the potential for increasing electricity demand in the Northwest.     Potential for upto 2GW of development. According to the developers, if an Energy Purchase Agreement (EPA) is acquired, the project would take approximately three years for finalization of supplier agreements, financial close on debt and equity, and construction. Obtaining an EPA is subject to the overall energy requirements in B.C, in particular, the demand for electricity in the northwest.

The Tribunal dismissed the majority of the Windstream's claims in their entirety, including with respect to Articles 1110 (Expropriation), 1102 (National Treatment) and 1103 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment). With respect to the claim alleging a breach of Article 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), the Tribunal agreed with Canada that Ontario’s decision to adopt the moratorium for reasons of scientific uncertainty was not itself a breach of Article 1105. The Tribunal concluded, however, that the failure of the Government of Ontario to undertake the scientific work necessary to address this regulatory uncertainty did amount to a breach of Article 1105. The Tribunal awarded the Claimant $25,182,900 CAD in damages and $2,912,432 CAD in costs.  The Government of Ontario agreed to pay the Award and interest in full.

Of the 2018-19 DKK 842m (€113m) budget total, some DKK 254m (€34m, i.e. 30%) is allocated to this first round in 2018; the remaining DKK 588m (€79m) is expected to be tendered in Autumn 2019.     Tender conditions stipulate that successful projects will receive a 20-year ‘price premium’ subsidy from the date of grid connection in the form of a fixed premium paid on top of the market price for electricity received. The wholesale price of electricity in Denmark, as traded on the Nord Pool, averaged DKK 230/MWh (~€31/MWh) across the whole of 2017. There is a bid cap on the price premium of DKK0.13/kWh (€17.4/MWh).     The tender criteria also require projects to be at a late development stage before participating; tenderers must submit an adopted local development plan with their bid, including an approved EIA report, a construction licence and a declaration of support from the municipal board (if located up to 8 km from the coastline).

Update 2014: As part of the Growth Pack 2014 (Vækstpakke 2014) proposals the overall capacity for this nearshore round was reduced from 450MW to 350MW. There was also a cap put on future bids of 0.70DKK per kWh for 50,000 full load hours. Relevant offers above this cap will be subject to political acceptance. The 50MW pilot projects were unaffected.    Update March 2015: A multisite tender will be issued. This means that 6 areas will be offered for tender at the same time and that projects within these sites will be competing against each other. The concession owner shall build and operate the wind farm and the export cable to the grid connection point on the shore. A tenderer is allowed to submit more than 1 tender.     Furthermore,conditional tendering for 2 sites will be possible, i.e. a tenderer can submit offers for up to 350 MW conditional upon the tenderer being awarded concession for both sites.    The DEA will award the concession(s) to the tenderer(s) who has submitted the offer(s) which make(s) it possible to obtain establishment of the highest total capacity within the maximum limit of 350 MW at the lowest total average price. The license and authorisation for operations will be given for 25 years with the possibility of prolongation if allowed under applicable law. The concession agreement(s) offer(s) a fixed price/kWh for 50 000 full load hours (contract for difference) which makes a very predictable income. The fixed price will not be indexed.    Following pre-qualification the DEA will invite a maximum of 10 applicants.  In order to ensure that only genuine, professional tenderes submit tenders, the DEA is introducing a penalty for defective performance of 100 000 000 DKK (EUR ~13.5m).

Between these two seas a maximum of 1610MW will be auctioned (1550 plus the remaining 60MW from the 2017 auction), with a carveout of 500MW reserved for Baltic Sea projects. Therefore 1110MW remains for the North Sea.    Around 5.5GW of projects are available to compete, although it is not expected that all Baltic Sea projects will do so under their current ownership. The key driver for zero-bids outlined by both winners in the 2017 auction are a late delivery (2024 or greater) and the associated technological advances this brings, and economies of scale. Site conditions (assumed to mean wind speed) was also mentioned by  DONG. Considering these three factors – 2024 or greater delivery, economies of scale, and wind resource, a simple analysis of the remaining North Sea Projects is possible.    It is assumed that He Dreiht will not bid in 2018 having already won with a significant bid, and Gode Wind 03 will not bid for further capacity in the auction due to a high density of 27.4MW/m2 following the first auction. The allocation of 900MW to He Dreiht means there is no longer any available capacity in Cluster 7 and therefore Vattenfall’s Global Tech 2 and EnBW’s OWP Albatros (not to be confused with ENBW’s Albatros also known as Hohe See Extension) must also be excluded. Vattenfall’s Atlantis I can technically bid for 14.4MW remaining in Cluster 6 but this is unlikely to be viable and is therefore excluded from consideration also.",,21-Apr-08,,,,,Vattenfall AB,Vattenfall AB,,613,73,73,TBD,,,,,,8.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: Jacket,73,,,,,,,Four-legged jacket structure 65m in height.,,,,35,39,37,40,83,106,10.02,41.73,54.266,5.95,North Sea,Europe,NO,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,81,33,,,It is envisaged that the cables will be subject to a minimum burial depth of 1.5m.,,,,

Between these two seas a maximum of 1610MW will be auctioned (1550 plus the remaining 60MW from the 2017 auction), with a carveout of 500MW reserved for Baltic Sea projects. Therefore 1110MW remains for the North Sea.    Around 5.5GW of projects are available to compete, although it is not expected that all Baltic Sea projects will do so under their current ownership. The key driver for zero-bids outlined by both winners in the 2017 auction are a late delivery (2024 or greater) and the associated technological advances this brings, and economies of scale. Site conditions (assumed to mean wind speed) was also mentioned by  DONG. Considering these three factors – 2024 or greater delivery, economies of scale, and wind resource, a simple analysis of the remaining North Sea Projects is possible.    It is assumed that He Dreiht will not bid in 2018 having already won with a significant bid, and Gode Wind 03 will not bid for further capacity in the auction due to a high density of 27.4MW/m2 following the first auction. The allocation of 900MW to He Dreiht means there is no longer any available capacity in Cluster 7 and therefore Vattenfall’s Global Tech 2 and EnBW’s OWP Albatros (not to be confused with ENBW’s Albatros also known as Hohe See Extension) must also be excluded.

The 1:50 model of the GICON® SOF tension leg platform foundation (TLP) including a wind turbine was lifted by a crane into the tank at the Laboratory in the Hydrodynamics, Energy and Atmospheric Environment of Central Nantes and CNRS (ECN).     The structure was then subjected to various wind and wave tests which according to Gicon it passed with flying colours. In ECN's water basin, waves with significant wave heights of 11.4m and 12.9m were simulated. The data collected during the tests will be intensively evaluated in the coming months by scientists at the the University of Rostock (LWET) and engineers from Edelstahl und Umwelttechnik Stralsund GmbH (ESG) in order to gain further insights into how to improve the platform.     According to Gicon they have also demonstrated that a levelized cost of electricity of less than 50 Euro/MWh is possible due to the use of cost efficient, steel-reinforced concrete composite components and the modular design.     The two partners, ESG and LWET, are currently planning to continue their tests with the third generation TLP into mid-2018.

DE0H,Gode Wind 3,Gode Wind III,Germany,Approved,WindSeeG: 1st Tender,Exclusive Economic Zone 1 (DolWin) (BSH Cluster 3),,http://www.dongenergy.com/en/media/newsroom/company-announcements-details?omxid=1557851,"20 Apr 2017: Analyst Update:   Results of the April 2017 auction resulted in a significantly lower than expected weighted average award price of €4.40/MWh. The lowest price was zero and the highest €60 MWh. Four bids were accepted totalling 1490MW meaning that the remaining 60MW will carry over to the 1 April 2018 auction for 1610MW.    Winners receive a grid connection, support as bid for 20 years and a permit for 25 years of operation (with the option to extend once by five years). DONG secured three connections in total (240MW  on NOR-1-1 for Borkum Borkum Riffgrund West II, 240MW on NOR-1-1 for OWP West and 110MW on NOR-3-3 for Gode Wind 3), with zero-subsidy bids for the projects connecting to NOR-1-1 (Dolwin5) and €60/MWh for Gode Wind 03 which has less economies of scale and connects a year earlier and therefore is considered to have less time to leverage new innovations. It is possible that the €60/MWh bid for Gode Wind 03 was strategically priced, made with the knowledge that there was an opportunity for a top-up project to fill any remaining auction volume that would be exceeded by the lower-priced, larger projects.    EnBW’s 900MW “He Dreiht” also secured a win with zero subsidy, also claiming the advantages of late-commissioning and scale economies. EnBW called for a review of Germany’s offshore wind goals.    DONG has clarified the following details about its transitional auction bids:  - Cluster 1 project (Borkum Riffgrund West II and OWP West) will be built as a single 480MW project using much larger turbines than available (“13-15MW turbines”).  - The transmission assets being out of scope has made a zero-bid possible.  - Cluster 1 has wind speeds in excess of 10m/s and extensive operational synergies with adjacent DONG projects.  - They expect extensive improvement and cost reduction opportunities across the balance of plant between now and 2024 including installation methods, foundations, cables, O&M lifetime etc.  - The allowance of an operational life of 30 years provides further opportunities for cost reduction.  - CAPEX per MW will be significantly lower than DKK 22-24m/MW guide price given in 2016.  - They have used a conservative estimate of German future wholesale price estimates, and added 250 basis points to WACC to account for market exposure.  - The main drivers of long-term energy prices are considered to be EU policy on CO2 prices, phase-out of coal and nuclear and the build-out of renewables. They consider national initiatives rather than regional policy as driving renewables growth. They assume a fast build-out of PV, onshore and offshore wind, all of which exert downward price pressure.  Phase-out of thermal capacity in accordance with national plans is assumed.DONG are also considering the option to lock-in prices through market-base contracts. E.g. corporate PPAs. Also hedging would be used.  - They consider winning the projects as an ‘option’ [albeit at significant cost] to build the windfarm. They may well add to the volume in next year’s tender. They are prepared to not-build the project if it appears to not create value nearer at FID. The cost of this would be €59m.  - The bid was based on a lowest price with no-regrets decision.  - Regarding the subsidy required for Gode Wind 3, it was considered to be built too early for the new turbine platform, and the site has slightly less attractive conditions.",1-Apr-22,1-Jan-12,1-Jan-21,2023,,2023,Ørsted A/S (formerly DONG Energy AS),Gode Wind 03 GmbH,,110,8,8,TBD,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: ,8,,Grounded,,,,,Jacket foundations probable (estimated).,,,,30,34,29,34,39,40,9.88,4.02,54.033,7.116,North Sea,Europe,NO,,Norddeich,1,HVDC Converter Station,DolWin6 (NOR-3-3),,1,15.8,4,155,,,,,,,,,"A shared connection has been proposed for connecting Gode Wind III/Godewind 04 and N-3.7 to DolWin6 converter, due to area's cable route only allowing for a maximum of two three-phase submarine cable systems.

Projects will share two substations, located in Borkum Riffgrund West I and Borkum Riffgrund West II project areas.",,"20 Apr 2017: Analyst view for 2018 auction:   Following on from the 2017 allocation, 2679MW of connections are available in the North Sea and 785MW in the Baltic. Between these two seas a maximum of 1610MW will be auctioned (1550 plus the remaining 60MW from the 2017 auction), with a carveout of 500MW reserved for Baltic Sea projects. Therefore 1110MW remains for the North Sea.    Around 5.5GW of projects are available to compete, although it is not expected that all Baltic Sea projects will do so under their current ownership. The key driver for zero-bids outlined by both winners in the 2017 auction are a late delivery (2024 or greater) and the associated technological advances this brings, and economies of scale. Site conditions (assumed to mean wind speed) was also mentioned by  DONG. Considering these three factors – 2024 or greater delivery, economies of scale, and wind resource, a simple analysis of the remaining North Sea Projects is possible.    It is assumed that He Dreiht will not bid in 2018 having already won with a significant bid, and Gode Wind 03 will not bid for further capacity in the auction due to a high density of 27.4MW/m2 following the first auction. The allocation of 900MW to He Dreiht means there is no longer any available capacity in Cluster 7 and therefore Vattenfall’s Global Tech 2 and EnBW’s OWP Albatros (not to be confused with ENBW’s Albatros also known as Hohe See Extension) must also be excluded.

DE64,Global Tech II,Global Tech III,Germany,On Hold/Canceled,,Exclusive Economic Zone 2 (BorWin) (BSH Cluster 7),Global Tech III  project area has now been combined with Global Tech II.,,"20 Apr 2017: Analyst view for 2018 auction:   Following on from the 2017 allocation, 2679MW of connections are available in the North Sea and 785MW in the Baltic. Between these two seas a maximum of 1610MW will be auctioned (1550 plus the remaining 60MW from the 2017 auction), with a carveout of 500MW reserved for Baltic Sea projects. Therefore 1110MW remains for the North Sea.    Around 5.5GW of projects are available to compete, although it is not expected that all Baltic Sea projects will do so under their current ownership. The key driver for zero-bids outlined by both winners in the 2017 auction are a late delivery (2024 or greater) and the associated technological advances this brings, and economies of scale. Site conditions (assumed to mean wind speed) was also mentioned by  DONG. Considering these three factors – 2024 or greater delivery, economies of scale, and wind resource, a simple analysis of the remaining North Sea Projects is possible.    It is assumed that He Dreiht will not bid in 2018 having already won with a significant bid, and Gode Wind 03 will not bid for further capacity in the auction due to a high density of 27.4MW/m2 following the first auction. The allocation of 900MW to He Dreiht means there is no longer any available capacity in Cluster 7 and therefore Vattenfall’s Global Tech 2 and EnBW’s OWP Albatros (not to be confused with ENBW’s Albatros also known as Hohe See Extension) must also be excluded. Vattenfall’s Atlantis I can technically bid for 14.4MW remaining in Cluster 6 but this is unlikely to be viable and is therefore excluded from consideration also.",,1-Jun-13,,,,,Vattenfall Europe Windkraft GmbH,Northern Energy Global Tech II GmbH,,486,79,79,TBD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: ,79,,,,,,,,,,,39,39,37,39,85,95,10.01,47.15,54.285,6.225,North Sea,Europe,NO,,,1,,Candidate to connect to NOR-7-1 or NOR-7-2,,3,15.4,,,,,,,,,,,Cable length and number of cables has been estimated where it is not yet decided by the developer.,,,,,,,,,

Between these two seas a maximum of 1610MW will be auctioned (1550 plus the remaining 60MW from the 2017 auction), with a carveout of 500MW reserved for Baltic Sea projects. Therefore 1110MW remains for the North Sea.    Around 5.5GW of projects are available to compete, although it is not expected that all Baltic Sea projects will do so under their current ownership. The key driver for zero-bids outlined by both winners in the 2017 auction are a late delivery (2024 or greater) and the associated technological advances this brings, and economies of scale. Site conditions (assumed to mean wind speed) was also mentioned by  DONG. Considering these three factors – 2024 or greater delivery, economies of scale, and wind resource, a simple analysis of the remaining North Sea Projects is possible.    It is assumed that He Dreiht will not bid in 2018 having already won with a significant bid, and Gode Wind 03 will not bid for further capacity in the auction due to a high density of 27.4MW/m2 following the first auction. The allocation of 900MW to He Dreiht means there is no longer any available capacity in Cluster 7 and therefore Vattenfall’s Global Tech 2 and EnBW’s OWP Albatros (not to be confused with ENBW’s Albatros also known as Hohe See Extension) must also be excluded.

The two-phase study started with a spatial investigation of potential locations after accounting for constraints relating to ports, shipping routes, sediments and environmentally sensitive areas. Also considered were cost and grid connection opportunities.   Five potential 12nm search areas were identified (see map) which were then cost modeled against locations within the EEZ. The study estimated that EUR 600m in subsidy savings were possible under assumptions of 2020 targets of 6GW. Next steps include more detailed spatial screening and cost modeling plus consultation before deciding whether development within the 12nm area can form part of the government’s ‘Structural Vision for Offshore Wind Energy’.",http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/duurzame-energie/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2013/06/27/quickscan-haalbaarheidsstudie-windparken-binnen-12-mijlszone.html,"26 Sep 2014: In September 2014 the government announced that this area was too small to be developed economically (insufficient for a 700MW platform) and would not be pursued further.

The tender procedure will run from 1st-14th March 2019. A decision on the applications will be made within 13 weeks of the tender closing. Follows comparative assessment similar to HKZ I&II. In the event that there are no acceptable subsidy free bids, a tender procedure including subsidies will be initiated.     Additional costs will also apply to the sites because 70% of lots III and IV are within the '12-mile zone ', where the Dutch state owns the seabed and thus requires a seabed lease to be established between the wind farm operator and The Central Government Real Estate Agency. This is based on a rate of €0.98/MWh every year, using a fixed total capacity of 350MW and 4,000 full load hours. It applies to 71.85% of site III and 68.23% of site IV and equates to €985,782.00/year and €936,115.60/year for the first year of operation for sites III and IV, respectively. A reservation fee of € 650/MW/year is also applied; €163,458.75/year for site III and €155,223.25/year for site IV.    A rental agreement for the array cabling between the wind turbines and the TenneT HKZ Beta platform also has to be signed. This is a fixed at a one-off amount of € 3.17 per m2 impacted corridor. The corridor is fixed at 0.3m and the fee equates to €40,997.61 for site III for 60km of cable and €45,420.71 for site IV for 70km of cable.

The two-phase study started with a spatial investigation of potential locations after accounting for constraints relating to ports, shipping routes, sediments and environmentally sensitive areas. Also considered were cost and grid connection opportunities.   Five potential 12nm search areas were identified (see map) which were then cost modeled against locations within the EEZ. The study estimated that EUR 600m in subsidy savings were possible under assumptions of 2020 targets of 6GW. Next steps include more detailed spatial screening and cost modeling plus consultation before deciding whether development within the 12nm area can form part of the government’s ‘Structural Vision for Offshore Wind Energy’.",http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/duurzame-energie/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2013/06/27/quickscan-haalbaarheidsstudie-windparken-binnen-12-mijlszone.html,"26 Sep 2014: In September 2014 the government announced that this area was too small to be developed economically (insufficient for a 700MW platform) and would not be pursued further.

OED wishes to assess which areas should now be opened. The premise is that it aims to open two areas. The assignment was received by NVE 22.12.2017.    NVE has now answered the request fromthe Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. The NVE estimates that the cost of offshore winds has declined faster than was the basis of the strategic impact assessment. However, this does not change the ranking of the sites.     NVE believes, based on its own assessments and received input, that the recommendations given in the 2012/2013 Strategic Impact Assessment are still valid.    If areas for energy production at sea are to be opened, the NVE recommends that the areas of Utsira Nord and either Sørlige Nordsjø I or II be opened in the first place. Sørlige Nordsjø I and II compete for the same network capacity in Norway so that the areas will be mutually exclusive, at least in the short term. The NVE has no priority between Sørlige Nordsjø I or II, because existing facts do not give reason to choose one in front of the other.

NO57,Hywind Tampen,,Norway,Planning,,Sogn og Fjordane,"Equinor and partners at Gullfaks and Snorre have decided to explore the possibilities of supplying the Gullfaks and Snorre fields with power from floating offshore wind. This could be the first time an offshore wind farm is directly connected to oil and gas platforms.  The project forecasts a reduction of CO2 emissions by more than 200,000 tonnes per year, equivalent to the emissions from 100,000 cars.  Equinor has performed an extensive study evaluating which oil and gas installations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) are suited for power supply from a floating offshore wind farm. The Snorre and Gullfaks fields in the Tampen area in the northern North Sea are the best match for realising this idea.  The solution to be further explored is a wind farm consisting of 11 wind turbines based on Equinor’s floating offshore wind concept, Hywind. The 8 MW turbines will have a combined capacity of 88 MW, and are estimated to meet about 35% of the annual power demand of the five Snorre A and B, and Gullfaks A, B and C platforms.  In periods of higher wind speed this percentage will be significantly higher.

NO58,NOAKA - North of Alvheim and Askja-Krafla,,Norway,Planning,,Hordaland,,,"01 May 2018: Aker BP announce plans for NOAKA oil production area, that includes powering area with offshore wind - ""The North of Alvheim and Askja-Krafla (NOAKA) area consists of the discoveries Frigg Gamma Delta, Langfjellet, Frøy, Fulla, Frigg, Rind and Askja-Krafla. Gross resources in the area are estimated to be more than 500 mmboe. Aker BP and the other partners have performed detailed studies of different development solutions for the NOAKA area. The premise defined by the authorities, and confirmed in recent dialogue, has been that a development should capture all discovered resources in the area and facilitate for future tie-ins of new discoveries. PROJECTS FIRST QUARTER REPORT 2018 | 9 These studies have resulted in two alternative development solutions. One solution involves two unmanned production platforms (“UPP”) or similar concepts, supported from an existing host in the area. The other solution involves a new hub platform in the central part of the area, with processing and living quarters (“PQ”). Aker BP’s recommendation is to develop the area with the PQ concept. This concept is the only alternative that allows for economic recovery of all discovered resources in the area, and provides higher resource recovery and socio-economic benefits than the alternative. The PQ concept also more is also the better alternative with regards to exploiting additional resources that may be discovered through future exploration. Aker BP’s ambition is to make NOAKA the first energy positive field development on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The goal is full electrification and zero emissions, enabled by power from shore combined with offshore wind. Aker BP aims to build further on its Ivar Aasen experience with onshore control rooms and a high degree of digitalization and automation to achieve maximum operational efficiency and the highest safety standards. The NOAKA PQ concept will be a new major field development on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Building on the positive experience from the alliance model, the ambition is to set a new standard in terms of cost per installed ton on the NCS.

NVE has divided the considered zones into three categories:    Category A: Wind power development within the zone   is technically and economically feasible, and will have   relatively few negative impacts. Grid connection is possible   before 2025.     Category B: Wind power development within the zone will   have challenges related to either technical aspects or conflict of interests/negative impacts. The challenges might   be resolved in the future through technology development,   grid measures and/or mitigation measures. NVE considers   that zones in this category can be opened when technology   matures, or when existing use of the areas changes.     Category C: Wind power development within the zone represents greater challenges than in the other two categories.   Conflicts of interest in the areas are not easily resolved.   Foreseen negative impacts are still considered acceptable.

At an event held in conjunction with the WindEurope Summit in Hamburg, Principle Power announced the successful decommissioning of WindFloat 1.  The project, originally installed in 2011, was a full lifecycle demonstration of the features and benefits of the WindFloat floating offshore wind foundation concept, and featured a Vestas V-80 2MW turbine.    Fabricated using the local supply chain and fully assembled and commissioned ashore, the WindFloat was then towed 400km to its project site, where it ultimately delivered over 17 GWh of energy to the grid and successfully operated through waves that at times exceeded 17m and winds of over 60 knots.  In July 2016, having completed all of its project objectives, Principle Power initiated the WindFloat decommissioning process.  The WindFloat foundation was detached from its mooring lines and electrical cable, and then towed back to Southern Portugal’s Port Sines facility, where the wind turbine was dissembled.  This was the first time an offshore wind turbine had been dismounted from a floating structure and it demonstrated the procedures to be used in commercial projects in the event of unanticipated major component failure.  The turbine has now been transferred to another project and the inspections reveal that the WindFloat foundation itself is in excellent condition.   “The WindFloat’s very successful 5-year deployment, in the open ocean of the Atlantic, has proven that the technology can meet its promise and is ready for commercialization,” said Joao Metelo, Principle Power’s President and CEO.  “The simplified assembly and installation, in addition to the ability to tow the unit to shore in the event of major maintenance issues, represents a sea-change in the way offshore wind can be done.  The WindFloat reduces risk, and cost, for deep or transitional depth offshore wind projects.”  Principle Power is now completing design for the WindFloat Atlantic project, a 25 MW project planned for deployment off of Northern Portugal which is backed by a consortium of major energy and industrial players including: EDP Renewables, Trust Wind (a 50/50 JV between  Engie and Marubeni), Chiyoda Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and Repsol.",10-Jan-11,,1-Sep-10,2011,,2011,"EDP Inovacao,Principle Power, Inc.,A.

Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;  1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016  2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms  3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development  In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.  The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.  36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.  A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.  Strong fundamental forces are driving Taiwan's ambitions. Nuclear power is being phased out and high forest and mountain coverage is constraining onshore wind growth.

Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;  1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016  2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms  3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development  In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.  The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.  36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.  A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.

Eleven offshore wind farms were identified as meeting the criteria required by the regulations for a review of their consents to be undertaken (Dudgeon, Greater Gabbard, Galloper, Hornsea Project One, Hornsea Two, East Anglia One, Triton Knoll, Creyke Beck A and B, Teesside A and B).     Hornsea Project One, East Anglia One and Triton Knoll, East Anglia Three have already been subjected to a HRA that included an assessment of the potential impacts on the qualifying features of the Southern North Sea SCI. Hence the remaining projects included in the HRA assessment include Dudgeon, Greater Gabbard, Galloper, Creyke Beck A and B, Teesside B.    The conclusion of the draft HRA, published 1st November 2018,  is that the consented offshore wind farms considered will not have an adverse effect on the SCI/cSAC either alone or in combination with other plans and projects provided that the parameters of each farm as assessed by the HRA are not exceeded. It is proposed that each relevant project’s marine licence be modified by inserting a suitable pre-construction condition (requiring a Site Integrity Plan (SIP)). The effect of the SIP would be to limit the windfarms to the parameters that have been assessed by this draft HRA. If these parameters are exceeded, then further assessment would be required. In such a circumstance, the project could only proceed if the MMO, in consultation with relevant bodies, has satisfied itself that the site would not be adversely affected.     BEIS invites statutory nature conservation bodies, non-governmental organisations, offshore wind farm representatives and any other interested parties to comment on the draft HRA.

It was determined that more constraints existed in the western site than the east e.g. oil and gas infrastructure and the presence of Ministry of Defence (MoD) Practice Area D807. Consequently it was decided that the Moray East site would be developed first. By 2016 it had become apparent that a number of the key constraints limiting development within the Moray West Site were starting to reduce e.g. the MoD Practice Area had been removed and plans to decommission the Beatrice Oil Field and associated infrastructure had been announced.

The platform is available for testing of models in the range 3.6-7MW.  The Titan is an offshore jack up platform composed of a unique “Y” shaped hull with a diameter slightly smaller than the wind turbine’s rotor, standing on three legs with a lifting system.    Known as a Dutch Tri-floater design, the platform cannot overturn – if any one arm begins to dip into the water, the other two arms push down to bring it back to horizontal.    Three contracted revenue streams are envisioned – potable water to local water districts and enriched brine and chemical feed stock to the agricultural, pharmaceutical, chemical, and general industry as well as electrical power to the grid.
