IE24,Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site,,Ireland,Consent Authorised,Demonstration - Hub,Mayo,"The Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) is being developed by Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to facilitate testing of full scale wave energy converters in an open ocean environment.
AMETS will be located off Annagh Head, west of Belmullet in County Mayo. The site was chosen following a detailed assessment of relevant sites on the west coast of Ireland. The site at Belmullet was chosen due to its:
- Wave power
- Sea bed conditions
- Access to the national gird
- Proximity to working ports (Killybegs and Belfast)

The development of the sites was initially for the deployment of the wave energy, providing two separate test locations at various depths of water to allow for a range of devices to be tested.
- Test Area A will be at 100m water depth and will be located some 16km out from shore (Belderra Strand).  Overall area of Test site A is 6.9 km2 (2.02 nautical square miles).
- Test Area B will be at 50m water depth and will be located 6km from the shore. Overall area of Test site A 1.5 km2 (0.44 nautical square miles).

SEAI will also construct a substation at a site close to Belderra strand. The substation will connect underwater cables to the national grid. SEAI plan to submit a planning application for the substation in 2016. Further details will follow.

The AMETS is an integral part of Ireland's Ocean Energy Strategy and is being developed in accordance with the national Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP).

In 2019, and according to the Irish 'Climate Action Plan 2019', SEAI filed documents to allow the installation of floating foundations at its test sites.",http://www.oceanenergyireland.ie/TestFacility/AMETS,"21 Oct 2020: AMETS is tendering for a market sounding exercise, on the proposed design, engineering, manufacture, transportation and installation of medium voltage export marine cable for the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) in Belmullet Co.

Following on from the 2017 allocation, 2679MW of connections are available in the North Sea and 785MW in the Baltic. Between these two seas a maximum of 1610MW will be auctioned (1550 plus the remaining 60MW from the 2017 auction), with a carveout of 500MW reserved for Baltic Sea projects. Therefore 1110MW remains for the North Sea.

Around 5.5GW of projects are available to compete, although it is not expected that all Baltic Sea projects will do so under their current ownership. The key driver for zero-bids outlined by both winners in the 2017 auction are a late delivery (2024 or greater) and the associated technological advances this brings, and economies of scale. Site conditions (assumed to mean wind speed) was also mentioned by
DONG. Considering these three factors – 2024 or greater delivery, economies of scale, and wind resource, a simple analysis of the remaining North Sea Projects is possible.

It is assumed that He Dreiht will not bid in 2018 having already won with a significant bid, and Gode Wind 03 will not bid for further capacity in the auction due to a high density of 27.4MW/m2 following the first auction. The allocation of 900MW to He Dreiht means there is no longer any available capacity in Cluster 7 and therefore Vattenfall’s Global Tech 2 and EnBW’s OWP Albatros (not to be confused with ENBW’s Albatros also known as Hohe See Extension) must also be excluded.

The consultation will introduce the project and seek feedback on our proposed:
• onshore infrastructure
• landfall location (where the offshore cables meet the land)
• onshore cable route
• onshore substation location
• offshore infrastructure

Initial concerns have been raised by the Swedish Defence Forces.",http://www.blekingeoffshore.se/,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,06-Dec-2010,,,,,,,,,"Eolus Vind (55%), Vingkraft (35%), VindIn (10%)",Blekinge Offshore AB,,2500,1000,Not Decided,,,,,3,6,350,700,180,110,140,Grounded: Not Specified,,,SEK 50000 million,50000,SEK,,,,,,10,38,10,40,12,14.52,8.96,115.54,55.956,14.9547,Baltic Sea,Europe,NO,Karlshamns Hamn,Nogersund,5,,Karlshamn,Karlshamn,12,27,,,,,,,,,,,12,3.77,Assume 12 cables in each trench.

Site is within state of Maine waters. State law allows placement of three wind turbines for a maximum of seven years.

Although the capacity is 12MW the application is for 25MW. Usage is limited to a maximum of 2 wind turbines, 3 meteorological towers per wind turbine, one submerged utility line with up to 25 MW capacity, up to 2 wave energy converters, and an ocean sensor package.

 The power will go into Monhegan Power District's electricity grid and Central Maine Power Co.'s electricity grid respectively. 300kV of the power will go to Monhegan Island which has high energy costs, with the remainder exported to the mainland.

Maine Aqua Ventus plan to install a pilot two 6-megawatt direct-drive turbines on concrete semi-submersible foundations. These concrete foundations could result in improvements in commercial-scale production and provide offshore wind projects with a cost-effective alternative to traditional steel foundations. It is stated that this floating platform would be suitable for the nearly 60% of United States' offshore wind resource located in deep waters.

Electricity has been priced at $230/MWh for 20 years. This is in comparison to $270/MWh that Statoil was proposing for its Hywind project.

Maine Aqua Ventus is considering revising its plan to incorporate either 9.5 or 12 MW turbines, and expects to make a decision by end-2019. It has received a Department of Energy fund of around $5 million to develop this technology.

These include: 1170 MW (78 WTGs) in Bormholm I and 1830 MW (122 WTGs) in Bornholm II; or 1005 MW (67 WTGs) in Bornholm I and 1005 MW (67 WTGs) in Bornholm II. Due to transmission distance of this design (estimated at <60 Km) it will require a 220 kV AC export system with offshore substations for each 500 MW cluster to bring power ashore. The energy island infrastructure will be located on Bornholm north of Hasle. From the Bornholm Energy Island it is assumed power is exported to Zealand (DK2) (1 GW) and via exchange connection to Poland (1-2 GW). 4C Offshore has estimated that both Bornholm offshore wind tenders will be allocated prior to the North Sea energy Island. The energy islands from the climate agreement 2020 are planned to be in operation in 2030 (including offshore wind farms and export cables). Pending political decision and further analysis, a very tentative timeline suggest that the tender could be undertaken in the period 2023-2025.

The wind farm will be used to demonstrate new technologies. Two Towers intends to  implement an innovative 'split joint' clamping connection solution between the foundation and tower. This technology, developed in collaboration with Van Oord, has two major advantages: it is maintenance-free and it reduces installation time. The consortium will also use innovative aluminium-based protection coating (TSA) which ensures a higher life expectancy of the mast and requires less maintenance will be tested. In addition, Two Towers will build oyster beds which will prevent erosion of the soil around the foundations of the turbines and help the restoration of the marine ecosystem in the North Sea. Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) monitoring system, an oval cable hole and Eco Scour technology will all be deployed at the site.

Site V is located in the area that was investigated as Site III.

Objectives are to demonstrate new technologies at a high Technology-Readiness Levels (TRL8)
• Enabling cost reduction
• Enhancing the market and export potential

Analysis by Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) estimates 1.2GW of wind is feasible in waters shallower than 20m, with a further 5GW in depths of 20m-50m. Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;
1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016
2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms
3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development
In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.
The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.
36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.
Strong fundamental forces are driving Taiwan's ambitions. Nuclear power is being phased out and high forest and mountain coverage is constraining onshore wind growth.

Analysis by Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) estimates 1.2GW of wind is feasible in waters shallower than 20m, with a further 5GW in depths of 20m-50m. Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;
1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016
2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms
3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development
In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.
The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.
36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.
Strong fundamental forces are driving Taiwan's ambitions. Nuclear power is being phased out and high forest and mountain coverage is constraining onshore wind growth.

Early stage proposals were presented locally and online for feedback from the community and key stakeholders. There were over 1,700 visits to the virtual exhibition and almost 300 pieces of feedback were received during the consultation period.
A high-level overview of all the feedback received during the first consultation is presented in the summary report. 89% of respondents agreed that that the UK needs to generate more energy from renewable sources, including offshore wind generation. 48% of respondents either supported or strongly supported the Extension Projects. 34% either did not support or strongly opposed the Extension Projects, and 18% provided a neutral view. Important aspects of the project which were highligthed in the consultation were: traffic and access during construction; ecology, visual impacts, tourism, recreation, heritage and archaeology, and fishing. Feedback received will help refine proposals.
   A more detailed report, along with on-going surveys and technical investigations will be shared in the Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) for phase two of the community consultation.

In New Jersey, new generating facilities are responsible for costs for transmission upgrades required to enable grid connection. PJM, the regional transmission organisation, requires new generators to complete its interconnection process, ultimately determining upgrade costs. Because they are uncertain, offshore wind applications are allowed to ""true up"" the portion of their offshore wind renewable energy certificate (OREC) attributed to transmission system upgrade costs. The ""true up"" mechanism proposed for Ocean Wind involves:
1. First $10 million -100% paid by Ocean Wind;
2. Between $10 million and $130 million - Ocean Wind pays 70% of costs incurred, with the remaining 30% recovered from ratepayers via an upgrade true-up;
3. Between $130 million and $174 million - Ocean Wind pays 50% of costs incurred, with the remaining 50% recovered from ratepayers vic;1 an upgrade true-up; and
4. Costs above $174 million -100% recovered from ratepayers via an upgrade true-up.

Ocean Wind's proposal will mitigate costs of transmission system upgrades by use of Capacity Interconnection Rights (CIRs), for which Orsted needed BPU approval (granted Sept 2019). Orsted's application requested interconnection at Oyster Creek Nuclear Power Station, Lacey Township, New Jersey, with the owner of the CIR at Oyster Creek completing a purchase agreement with Ocean Wind. Ocean Wind estimates the cost of the CIR Purchase Agreement plus remaining upgrade costs is approx $25 million less than without CIR. As scope of system upgrades is reduced, this also lowers the risk of delay to the project schedule.

SE41,Fällbådan,,Sweden,Concept/Early Planning,,"Södermanland, Oxelösund",,,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,Rewind Offshore,Rewind Offshore AB,,,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,6,130,,,,23.4,8.55,148.48,58.5163,17.3686,Baltic Sea,Europe,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SE07,Finngrunden,,Sweden,Cancelled,,Uppsala,"Economics of offshore wind in Sweden is marginal at best. Costs need to come down, offshore wind specific incentives need to be introduced, or an export market developed through collaboration with another EU member state - such ""joint projects"" are being pursued by Sweden and will require the establishment of an MoU similar to that under negotiation between UK and Ireland.",http://www.wpd-sweden.com,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,15-Sep-2009,,,,,,,,,WPD,wpd Offshore Finngrunden AB,,1500,1110,Not Decided,,,,,6,,,185,,,,Grounded: Gravity-Base,,,SEK 36000 million,36000,SEK,,,,,,3,42,5,20,33.22,47.53,8.75,238.07,60.9973,18.245,Gulf of Bothnia,Europe,NO,,,,,,,6,50.75,,,,,,,,,,,12,12.55,Assume all the cables are in the same trench (4x3 trefoil/flatbed).

FR76,France - 2023 Tender (Fixed),,France,Development Zone,French Fixed Tender (2023 Award),To be confirmed,,,"21 Apr 2020: The French government confirmed its Multi-Year Energy Programming/Les programmations pluriannuelles de l’énergie  (PPE) which forms the strategic roadmap for energy and climate for the period 2019-2023 and 2024-2028. Following the online public consultation which took place from 20th January to 20th February 2020 with 6,295 contributions recieved, the PPE was formally adopted by decree on 21st April 2020. A summary of the public opinions, the reasons for the decision to adopt the PPE, an environmental statement, the final PPE document (and summaries) and the adoption decree have been published by the ministry.

The PPE sets targets of 40% renewable energy generation by 2030. All coal plants are to close by 2022, and 14 nuclear reactors by 2035 to achieve 50% share of nuclear electricity. The long term goal is carbon neutrality by 2050.

A first draft of the PPE was published January 2019 but there was considerable backlash that renewable energy targets, including offshore wind, were too low. Offshore wind objectives have been revised upwards taking advantage of the drop in prices recorded on the Dunkirk tender in June 2019. Overall, 2.4 GW will be installed by 2023, and 3.75 GW will be tendered from 2020-2023, leading to an operational target of 5.2-6.2 GW (against previous targets of 4.7-5.2 GW) by 2028.

The tender for a 1 GW project off the coast of Normandy will be launched in 2021. The Oléron offshore wind area has also been re-introduced to the PPE after omission from the January 2019 draft with tender awarded expected 2021-22. A further 1 GW fixed offshore wind farm will be awarded in 2023. One 250 MW floating project in Brittany will be awarded in 2021 and two 250 MW floating projects in the Mediterranean will be awarded in 2022.

From 2024 the Government has increased annual targets from 500 MW to 1 GW for a combination of fixed and/or floating.

A summary of the public opinions, the reasons for the decision to adopt the PPE, an environmental statement, the final PPE document (and summaries) and the adoption decree have been published by the ministry.

The PPE sets targets of 40% renewable energy generation by 2030. All coal plants are to close by 2022, and 14 nuclear reactors by 2035 to achieve 50% share of nuclear electricity. The long term goal is carbon neutrality by 2050.

A first draft of the PPE was published January 2019 but there was considerable backlash that renewable energy targets, including offshore wind, were too low. Offshore wind objectives have been revised upwards taking advantage of the drop in prices recorded on the Dunkirk tender in June 2019. Overall, 2.4 GW will be installed by 2023, and 3.75 GW will be tendered from 2020-2023, leading to an operational target of 5.2-6.2 GW (against previous targets of 4.7-5.2 GW) by 2028.

two turbines with heights up to 200m and three with heights up to 265m located 4.5km offshore. The offshore wind turbines will be commercial- or demonstration wind turbines of next generation offshore wind turbines with different foundation concepts or a combination thereof. European Energy is working towards submitting a new Environmental Impact Assessment with construction and commissioning scheduled for 2021/2022.",,"30 Oct 2020: On 5 October 2020, European Energy requested an extension of the deadline for submitting the feasibility study report to 31 March 2021, on the grounds that European Energy cannot implement keep the mapping and the subsequent description, interpretation and assessment of the collected data by the deadline of 30 October 2020. The Minister of Climate, Energy and Supply decided on 30 October 2020 to extend the feasibility study permit for Frederikshavn Offshore Wind Farm. The preliminary investigation report must thus have been received by the Danish Energy Agency on 31 March 2021.

Context: On 21 December 2018, the Ministry of Energy, Utilities and Climate awarded an exploration permit for European Energy A / S. An important purpose of the feasibility studies is to collect data and lights for use in assessing the potential impact of the offshore wind farm on environment, nature, air traffic etc.The license is valid for the period from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2020. The results of the feasibility studies will be compiled in an environmental impact report, which must be submitted to the DEA by 31 December 2020.
On 10 December 2019 the Danish Energy Agency  extended the pre-investigation permit to 30 October 2020. The extension was granted to ensure that the the quality of the feasibility study report came to live up to the Environmental Assessment Act provisions.
In July 2020, the Danish Energy Agency conducted an external review of European Energys existing data basis for the environmental impact report. Based on the external review, the Danish Energy Agency requested European Energy to lead new seabed mappings in the cable corridor from the offshore wind farm to land.",01-Jan-2024,01-Jan-2024,12-Feb-2016,,,,01-Sep-2024,2024,72,Low,"Originally owned by Orsted and then acquired by EDF in 2015, the project lost out to Nissum Bredning in the Danish Energy Agency's pilot project scheme to support new technology in 2016.

The 2018 review of the 2012 report did not put Frøyagrunnene forward as a recommended candidate for opening to offshore wind. Utsira Nord/Sørlige Nordsjø are better suited, with fewer consequences overall. The site is also relatively small (58 km2) and so is less flexible for several land uses.

The assessment in 2012/2013 concluded that the a 200 MW wind farm at Frøyagrunnene could be connected via a 132 kV connection to Bremangerlandet or Svelgen, and further to Ålfoten which is the closest transmission network station on the new 420 kV line Ørskog - Sogndal. Furthermore, it was assumed that the development of Frøyagrunnene could share network connection with other projects on land in the same area, but could also lead to competition for grid capacity. Depending on the time of realization, the network capacity of the local 132 kV network can already be utilized so that new reinforcements must be made. Frøyagrunnene and Olderveggen compete for the same network capacity in the transmission network. Statnett's assessment in 2012 was that with the new 420 kV line between Ørskog and Sogndal, there may be capacity in the transmission network to either Frøyagrunnene or Olderveggen. It was therefore considered that wind turbines in one of these two investigation areas could possibly be connected to the grid by land by 2025. After the 2018 re-evaluation, the current situation for the network in Sogn og Fjordane is quite similar to the assessment made in 2012.",,"02 Jul 2019: Following an initial announcement of intention in June 2019, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy has submitted the proposal to request opening of areas for offshore wind and also a new regulation to supplement the ocean energy act and clarify the leasing process. This follows on from recommendations made by the Water and Energy Directorate (NVE) in early 2018, that Utsira Nord and Sørlige Nordsjø I or 2 should be prioritised for development. However, the announcement in June did not include Sørlige Nordsjø I and this was confirmed in the July proposal, which includes areas Utsira Nord,  Sandskallen – Sørøya Nord and potentially Sørlige Nordsjø II.

The agreements for Buitengaats and ZeeEnergie mean that a premium price will be paid for the majority of the power for 15 years and incorporate mechanisms that reduce revenue exposure to wind production volatility.    The government subsidy is equal to the tender's winning bid price bid price (in this case, for Gemini is €168.9/MWh)  minus the average 'grey' (i.e. wholesale) electricity price for each year. This is similar to a ""Contract for Difference"" scheme. However in order to prevent over or under subsidy   -  if the average electricity price is too low then the government subsidy is capped equal to the bid price minus a base electricity price (€44)  -  If the average electricity price is higher than the bid price then the operator receives the extra income.     The  subsidy, paid by the government is available for 15 years at a maximum of 2,900 full load hours per year. There is also a distance correction to the subsidy but this is not published.    So, for example, in a single year the project is entitled to 2900hr x 600MW = 1,740,000 MWhr of support at €168.9/MWhr.  If the average grey electricity price was the base price, i.e. €44/MWh then the government subsidy would be 168.9-44=€124.9/MWhr  So the annual subsidy would be 1,740,000 x 124.9 = €217.3million  which over 15 years = €3.3bn    The project has been awarded subsidies up to a total of €3.6bn.

Following on from the 2017 allocation, 2679MW of connections are available in the North Sea and 785MW in the Baltic. Between these two seas a maximum of 1610MW will be auctioned (1550 plus the remaining 60MW from the 2017 auction), with a carveout of 500MW reserved for Baltic Sea projects. Therefore 1110MW remains for the North Sea.

Around 5.5GW of projects are available to compete, although it is not expected that all Baltic Sea projects will do so under their current ownership. The key driver for zero-bids outlined by both winners in the 2017 auction are a late delivery (2024 or greater) and the associated technological advances this brings, and economies of scale. Site conditions (assumed to mean wind speed) was also mentioned by
DONG. Considering these three factors – 2024 or greater delivery, economies of scale, and wind resource, a simple analysis of the remaining North Sea Projects is possible.

It is assumed that He Dreiht will not bid in 2018 having already won with a significant bid, and Gode Wind 03 will not bid for further capacity in the auction due to a high density of 27.4MW/m2 following the first auction. The allocation of 900MW to He Dreiht means there is no longer any available capacity in Cluster 7 and therefore Vattenfall’s Global Tech 2 and EnBW’s OWP Albatros (not to be confused with ENBW’s Albatros also known as Hohe See Extension) must also be excluded.

US5R,Fairways South (Draft WEA),,United States,Development Zone,New York Bight Call Areas - New York Offshore Wind Master Plan,New York,"New York State’s offshore wind energy goal is to develop 2,400 megawatts (MW) by 2030.

On 2nd October 2017, New York State submitted an identified Area for Consideration to the federal government’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). This comes after rigorous fieldwork, analysis, and stakeholder outreach regarding appropriate locations for wind installations off New York State’s Atlantic Coast. The State submitted extensive information supporting the Area for Consideration, which the State views as best suited for future offshore wind development.
New York State requests that within this Area of Consideration, BOEM identify and lease at least four new Wind Energy Areas, each capable of supporting at least 800 megawatts. BOEM’s identification and leasing of these Wind Energy Areas will encourage competition among offshore wind developers, help reduce costs, and support New York in meeting its commitment of 2,400 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, enough to power 1.2 million New York State households.
As part of its Master Plan process, New York began with over 16,000 square miles of area called the Offshore Study Area. The Area for Consideration represents approximately ten percent of the original Offshore Study Area, refined through a comprehensive process based on available data and guided by stakeholder feedback, aiming to maximize benefits and minimize conflicts to ocean users, including both people and wildlife, and was developed following interagency deliberation within New York State..",https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Programs/Offshore-Wind/New-York-Offshore-Wind-Master-Plan,"23 Jul 2019: Update 23/07/19: BOEM stated that there have been no updates.

The met station is expected to collect data for a period of two years.

The offshore wind data collection platform is installed at about 16 kms from the shore in the territorial waters of Gujarat under the control of the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) at a water depth of about 11 meters (w.r.t Chart Datum), where the tidal range is 4 meters (m). The support platform is at a height of about 14m above water level. Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) has provided the project with valuable insights about sea properties during various seasons, navigation routes apart from administrative permissions and facilitation.

The unmanned met station will be powered by solar energy and will be remotely monitored for maintenance needs. Engineers will visit the site for general inspection periodically and cater to the servicing needs in case of a breakdown.

SE39,Gustav Dahlén 1,,Sweden,Concept/Early Planning,,"Södermanland, Oxelösund",,,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind.

SE32,Hakefjorden - Vindplats Göteborg,,Sweden,Failed Proposal,,Göteborg Kommun,"Economics of offshore wind in Sweden is marginal at best. Costs need to come down, offshore wind specific incentives need to be introduced, or an export market developed through collaboration with another EU member state - such ""joint projects"" are being pursued by Sweden and will require the establishment of an MoU similar to that under negotiation between UK and Ireland.",,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities.

Analysis by Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) estimates 1.2GW of wind is feasible in waters shallower than 20m, with a further 5GW in depths of 20m-50m. Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;
1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016
2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms
3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development
In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.
The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.
36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.
Strong fundamental forces are driving Taiwan's ambitions. Nuclear power is being phased out and high forest and mountain coverage is constraining onshore wind growth.

 The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate  has been commissioned by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy  to assess whether significant changes have been made that affect the recommendations given in the 2012/2013 Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment. The NVE concluded in the Havvind report that the areas of Sørlige Nordsjø I or II, Utsira  Nord, Frøyagrunnene  and Sandskallen-Sørøya  Nord distinguished themselves with good technical economic conditions and opportunities for networking by 2025. OED wishes to assess which areas should now be opened. The premise is that it aims to open two areas. The assignment was received by NVE 22.12.2017.

NVE has now answered the request fromthe Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. The NVE estimates that the cost of offshore winds has declined faster than was the basis of the strategic impact assessment. However, this does not change the ranking of the sites.

NVE believes, based on its own assessments and received input, that the recommendations given in the 2012/2013 Strategic Impact Assessment are still valid.

If areas for energy production at sea are to be opened, the NVE recommends that the areas of Utsira Nord and either Sørlige Nordsjø I or II be opened in the first place. Sørlige Nordsjø I and II compete for the same network capacity in Norway so that the areas will be mutually exclusive, at least in the short term. The NVE has no priority between Sørlige Nordsjø I or II, because existing facts do not give reason to choose one in front of the other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,,,,,Floating: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1,,63.0256,6.9991,To be decided,Europe,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities.

As part of a competitive tender, SMart Wind Ltd. was awarded rights to the Hornsea Zone in 2009.

Ørsted Wind Power A/S aquired Hornsea Project One in February 2015 and, in August 2015, Orsted Power (UK) Ltd acquired SMart Wind Ltd and the Hornsea Zone, together with the development rights for Hornsea Project Two, Three and Four. Subsequently in March 2016, the Hornsea Zone was terminated and project specific agreements were agreed with the Crown Estate instead.

Ørsted submitted a consent application in May 2018. Hornsea Three may be constructed in a single phase or two phases, including the potential for an overlap or a gap between the completion of construction of one phase and the start of construction of another.

The project design includes up to 300 offshore wind turbines with rotor diameter of 265 m and a maximum blade tip height of 325 m. There are several foundation types that are being considered (including monopiles, suction bucket jacket foundations, piled jacket foundations, mono suction buckets and gravity base structures). All floating concepts have been removed.

It is likely the array cable system will use HVAC technology, but it is also possible that the system will consist of an alternative option such as a HVDC or low frequency HVAC array cable system.

Hornsea Three may use HVAC or HVDC export cables, or could use a combination of both technologies in separate electrical systems. Hornsea Three is applying for both HVAC and HVDC transmission to allow for suitable flexibility to ensure a low cost of energy to the UK consumer.

Hornsea Three may also require up to 15 interconnector cables between the substations.

Depending on the transmission systen used up to 12 separate offshore transformer substations could be required.  Up to four separate offshore HVDC converter substations could be required. Up to four separate offshore suface HVAC booster substations or 6 offshore subsea offshore booster stations could be required.

Up to 3 offshore accomodation platforms could be required. The aim being to reduce trips to the Hornsea Three array area and time spent in transit, in order to decrease down time for faults and repairs.

Offshore export cables will connect to the onshore export cables and transfer the power onwards to the onshore HVDC converter/HVAC substation (potentially via an onshore HVAC booster station in the case of HVAC). 6 onshore circuits would be required for HVAC or 4 ( plus one HVAC circuit) for HVDC.

NO57,Hywind Tampen,,Norway,Pre-Construction,,Sogn og Fjordane,"Equinor and partners at Gullfaks and Snorre have decided to explore the possibilities of supplying the Gullfaks and Snorre fields with power from floating offshore wind. This could be the first time an offshore wind farm is directly connected to oil and gas platforms.
The project forecasts a reduction of CO2 emissions by more than 200,000 tonnes per year, equivalent to the emissions from 100,000 cars.
Equinor has performed an extensive study evaluating which oil and gas installations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) are suited for power supply from a floating offshore wind farm. The Snorre and Gullfaks fields in the Tampen area in the northern North Sea are the best match for realising this idea.
The solution to be further explored is a wind farm consisting of 11 wind turbines based on Equinor’s floating offshore wind concept, Hywind. The 8 MW turbines will have a combined capacity of 88 MW, and are estimated to meet about 35% of the annual power demand of the five Snorre A and B, and Gullfaks A, B and C platforms.  In periods of higher wind speed this percentage will be significantly higher.

IM01,Isle of Man Offshore Wind Farm,,Isle of Man,Concept/Early Planning,,Isle of Man,"Orsted was awarded a lease to conduct preliminary surveys in 2015. The lease covers an area of 253 km2, with an average water depth of 21 m. The site is between the 6 nm limit and the territorial limit, North of Douglas Head and south of Maughold Head. The intention was to export 3,000 GWh/yr (50% capacity factor) to the UK National Grid. Orsted undertook intial site surveys from 2016. However, progress has been limited because projects in Isle of Man waters cannot bid for a CfD. This presents a barrier to development as there is no route to market available. As of early 2020, with the publication of a net zero Climate Action Plan dicussions regarding the future of the project are ongoing, and options include the supply power to the IOM and the UK via PPAs or CfD.",,"21 Jan 2020: update: The Tynwald voted unanimously to approve the first phase of the plan in late January and has committed to introduce a Climate Bill in 2020 and phase two of the plan in 2021.

The Isle of Man (IOM) Government has published a Climate Action Report  targeting net zero emissions by 2050 which will be considered in Tynwald on 21 January 2020. As part of the Action Plan the Council of Ministers commits to securing 75% of electricity from renewable sources by 2035 with actions including the launch of a prior information notice/expressions of interest (pre-tender) for an offshore wind farm with providers selected in 2023 and generation starting by 2028-2030 depending on high-low scenarios.

The plan discusses various options for progressing Orsted's IOM offshore wind farm. The main barrier to date has been that the UK CfD scheme does not accept bids from outside UK waters (including the IOM and the Channel Islands). This has meant Orsted has no route to market and is currently unable to export power to the UK. However, with ambition to decarbonise the Isle of Man power generation and expected increase in electrification Isle of Man is now considering options where some or all power is exported to the Isle of Man. Also due to declining cost of offshore wind projects in IOM may be able to proceed without a CfD and instead via PPAs or merchant agreements e.g. the Manx Utilities Authority (MUA) could purchase the electricity from Orsted through a long term PPA (25 years). Suggested options include 150 MW to be exported to the IOM and surplus could be stored or 550 MW exported to the UK, using DC interconnectors, via CfD mechanism or PPA/merchant agreements, subject to shifts in the economics of the UK electricity market. Private sector investment for this option would be in the region of £2.5 bn. Another option includes the use of the IOM as a hub in the Irish Sea with multiple inter connectors to the UK and Ireland. This concept, whilst providing environmental and cost optimising benefits, is limited by the complexity of the proposal and involvement of multiple government jurisdictions.

Action points from the plan include encouraging the UK to amend it's CfD scheme; investigate the potential for floating offshore wind as costs decline; conduct a full technical and economic appraisal of options highlighted to progress the development of Orsted's project; investigate the use of gigastack electrolysis technology and hydrogen coupled with offshore wind. Significant grid reinforcement will also be required.",,,,,,,,,,,,Isle of Man Government,Ørsted A/S (formerly DONG Energy AS),,700,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,10,23,,,,15.99,,142.8,54.2275,-4.0909,Irish Sea,Europe,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'

Wpd won the rights for the Kaikas project in 2013 but in 2015 the BSH halted licensing procedures in zones 3-5 due to lack of prospects for near-term grid connections. The project was then excluded from entering the 2017-2018 transitional tenders which were tendered under the WindSeeG Law which came into force in 2017 and was not granted a ""right of entry"" for later tenders as other approved wind farms were..

Wpd submitted a lawsuit against the WindSeeG Act in 2017 claiming that ""In order to meet the regulatory requirements, we have invested a significant amount, then lost all possibilities for implementation through a system change"".

The Court ruled that wpd was to receive compensation. However, wpd chief operating officer Achim Berge Olsen has stated that he is unsatisfied with the  “financial compensation” as wpd is more concerned that an approved project is unable to be built and contribute to targets.

Industry body BWO, comments that ""it is absolutely incomprehensible why a project that has already been approved should not be built"". The BWO took the opportunity to criticise recent ammendments to the WindSeeG Law in June 2020 which would see introduction of a second bid component. BWO state that this will devalue the ""right of entry"" as it considerably reduces the profitability and thus the likelihood of projects being realized.

SouthPoint Wind has since issued a $1.2-billion lawsuit against the provincial government for issuing a moratorium on offshore wind farms.
Claim is due to the fact that the Ministry of Natural Resources arbitrarily cancelled all applications for offshore wind development and revoked SouthPoint Wind’s Applicant of Record status, leaving it with no certainty as to where its projects could be located and as a result of such uncertainty, previous site specific environmental studies and reports completed at great expense to SouthPoint were rendered useless because they related to tracts of land for which SPW no longer held Applicant of Record status, resulting in significant financial hardship to the Plaintiff.

- Development of local renewable resources,
- Support of energy-related local economic developments,
- Offtake arrangements,
- Strong local community involvement and support,
- Drive investments and create jobs in the region,
- Revitalise the Port of Humboldt Bay.

In April 2018 Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) commissioned the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to conduct an Offshore Wind Interconnection Study, with an initial deposit of $400,000. The study will be used to determine necessary upgrades for the grid connection of a 100-150MW floating offshore wind farm off the coast of Northern California. According to RCEA, understanding the potential to connect to the grid and the associated costs are critical early factors in evaluating the feasibility of the wind farm.

The phase-1 has been completed and the results will identify transmission system impacts caused by the project, necessary system upgrades, associated costs assigned to the project. Reportedly, phase one has presented favourable results and CAISO is now proceeding with phase two.

RCEA has also begun work with the Humboldt Bay Harbour District to address the project’s harbour infrastructure needs.

SE09,Klasarden,,Sweden,Cancelled,,Gotland Kommun,,,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,OM O2,OM O2 (formerly O2 Vindkompaniet),,48,,"NM 72/2000 (NEG Micon ), NEG Micon Unknown",,,NM 72/2000,NEG Micon Unknown,,2,,,,,72,Grounded: Gravity-Base,,,,,,,,,,,5,10,,,1.58,,8.94,,57.0583,18.1615,Baltic Sea,Europe,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The government and a broad majority in the Folketing signed an agreement on an ambitious climate plan on 22nd June. The agreement, together with the agreement on a green waste sector, forms the first part of the government's overall climate action plan.

The agreement includes plans for:
·	Establishment of two energy Islands by 2030; one at Bornholm at 2 GW and one in the North Sea at 3 GW. The North Sea Island will be expanded to 10 GW in the long term. The island in the North Sea is being expanded in phases as electricity consumption rises and the energy island joins trade links with other countries. The energy islands must not only produce electricity, but also in the long term be able to connect technologies that can store or convert the green power to green fuels (so-called ""Power-to-X""). It is a condition of the projects that they are profitable. Work on the energy islands will start immediately and parties involved will be continuously updated of the scheduling.
·	The establishment of the second wind farm agreed in the 2018 energy agreement will be located at Hesselø with a capacity of 1 GW. The parties have agreed that the wind farm should be operational by 2027 and have advanced the schedule compared to the original 2018 agreement.
·	The third wind farm agreed in the 2018 energy agreement will be included in the first phase of the energy islands and will be realised by 2030.
·	The funds reserved for the connection of second and third projects of the Energy Agreement 2018 will be re-prioritized to finance elements of the agreement.
·	The parties agree that DKK 4 million will be allocated in 2020, DKK 121 million in 2021 and DKK 89 million in 2022 for a preliminary study of the two energy islands and the park at Hesselø, at the same time with the re-prioritization of the funds allocated for preliminary studies of parks 2 and 3 of the Energy Agreement 2018. The preliminary studies are the first step in the establishment of the energy islands.
·	The energy islands and Hesselø must be based on the principles of the Energy Agreement 2018, which states that in future, offshore wind should be market-driven as far as possible without public support.
·	Other key points of the agreement include: promotion of Power-to-X plants and CO2 capture technology; electrification of the heating sector; Support for biogas and other green gases; Sustainability requirements for biomass for energy; Green restructuring of the industry; and Transition to market-driven expansion of solar cells and onshore wind. The so-called mill ceiling (maximum of 1,850 onshore wind turbines) will be postponed from 2030 to 2040 and CfD tenders for new onshore turbines and solar will be launched in 2020 and 2021. In total, the agreement between the government and the Left, DF, Radical Left, SF, the Unity List, Conservatives, Liberal Alliance and the Alternative, together with the climate agreement for waste, results in CO2e reductions of DKK 3.4 million tonnes by 2030.

Based on Article 4, the price level of an awarded power purchase contract will be subject to review ten years after the commissioning date. A potential decrease of the power purchase price aims to ensure that beyond the 8.5% (after taxes) Internal Rate of Returns (IRR) of the project, any additional gains are equally shares between the State (50%) and the developer/producer (50%), taking into account the changes on the economic operating conditions during installation.

Based on Article 5, winners of the 2015's ADEME auction will have to request for a power purchase contract following the provisions of articles R. 314-3 and R. 314-4 of the energy code, including:
i) a copy of the 2015's ADEME's decision;
ii) the number of the planned wind turbines;
iii) the planned capacity of the project, meaning the multiplication of the wind turbine units by their nominal power output;
iv) the maximum active power supply produced by all the installed wind turbines, and, if applicable, the maximum active self-consumption power required
v) the geographic location of each wind turbine using the WGS84 system.

Based on Article 6, In the case when a developer modifies the initial proposed power purchase contract, then the developer will have to send a request for modification, including the characteristics subject to the modifications.  The modification request can only be related to the following elements within the limits set by article R 314-5 of the energy code:
i) information of the new developer/owner;
ii) the number of the wind turbines;
iii)  a at most 30% decrease of the installed power, capacity, maximum active power supply, if applicable a modification on the maximum active self-consumption power as defined in Article 4 (of April 9th, 2020 Order) ;

On 2nd October 2017, New York State submitted an identified Area for Consideration to the federal government’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). This comes after rigorous fieldwork, analysis, and stakeholder outreach regarding appropriate locations for wind installations off New York State’s Atlantic Coast. The State submitted extensive information supporting the Area for Consideration, which the State views as best suited for future offshore wind development.
New York State requests that within this Area of Consideration, BOEM identify and lease at least four new Wind Energy Areas, each capable of supporting at least 800 megawatts. BOEM’s identification and leasing of these Wind Energy Areas will encourage competition among offshore wind developers, help reduce costs, and support New York in meeting its commitment of 2,400 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, enough to power 1.2 million New York State households.
As part of its Master Plan process, New York began with over 16,000 square miles of area called the Offshore Study Area. The Area for Consideration represents approximately ten percent of the original Offshore Study Area, refined through a comprehensive process based on available data and guided by stakeholder feedback, aiming to maximize benefits and minimize conflicts to ocean users, including both people and wildlife, and was developed following interagency deliberation within New York State.",https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Programs/Offshore-Wind/New-York-Offshore-Wind-Master-Plan,01 Feb 2020: The second phase of BLIX's site investigations for soil reduction commenced in February 2020.,,,,,,,,2028,1200,Medium,"NEW JERSEY: (Model as 1.2 GW): New Jersey is soliciting 1.2 GW in 2022, for construction by 2029, towards its 7.5 GW by 2035 target.",BOEM,,,,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,40,58,,,,79.2,,514.07,40.0434,-72.8312,Atlantic Ocean,North America,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SE38,Marakallen,,Sweden,Dormant,,Luleå,,,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,Ventovarium,Marakallen Vindbruk AB,,,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,112,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,1.3,36,,,,32.5,8.57,97.23,65.2476,22.5657,Gulf of Bothnia,Europe,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The move to rename the projects is to distinguish the two standalone offshore wind farms from neighbouring project, Seagreen 1.
Berwick Bank wind farm is located 54km at its nearest point to the coast off East Lothian. Marr Bank wind farm is located 43km at its nearest point to the coast off East Lothian.
The proposed installed capacity of the Berwick Bank wind farm and Marr Bank wind farm could be between 1400MW and 2300MW and 900MW and 1,850MW, respectively.
Berwick Bank wind farm has secured a grid connection at Branxton, near Torness, in East Lothian.
Berwick Bank could be operational as soon as 2027 with Marr Bank following slightly later timescales.

AU03,Mid West,"Mid West Wind & Solar Project, WA-481-P",Australia,Concept/Early Planning,,Western Australia,"In September Pilot Energy Limited announced that it is commencing  a detailed feasibility study to pursue the development for the Mid West Wind and Solar Project. Includes a complex of offshore wind, onshore wind and solar. Pilot Energy has developed a conceptual development layout for a 4-stage development for up to 1.1 GW of offshore wind power generation  This is comprised of up to seventy-eight (78) 14MW wind turbines.
Average wind speed: 9 m/s at a hub height 100 meters
Location: permit zone (WA-481-P) is over 8600 km2 in the North Perth Basin extending from North of Oakajee, Western Australia to south of Cervantes, Western Australia covering.
Water depth/Distance from Shore: The eastern boundary  is approximately 10 km offshore in relatively shallow water depths ranging between 20 to 40-meter water depth along the entire eastern portion of the permit from 10 km to 30 km offshore.  7600 km2 (88%) of the permit area is in water depths of 60 meters or less.",https://www.pilotenergy.com.au/australia-wa-481-p,"09 Nov 2020: Pilot Energy are to sell a 78.75% interest in and transfer operatorship of offshore Perth Basin exploration permit WA-481-P to Triangle Energy, an oil producer. This follows announcement in October that Pilot would acquire Key Petroleum's 40% stake in WA-481-P to become sole owners. Pending completion of this acquisition and after the sale to Triangle, Pilot will retain a 21.25% non-operated working interest in the WA-481-P permit area. Triangle will pay Pilot $300,000 in cash and fund Pilot through completion of the WA-481-P Permit 3 Year work program (up to a maximum of $1.22 million). Pilot will be designated the operator’s representative in connection with all matters relating to the interface with any potential offshore wind development affecting the WA-481-P permit area.

Triangle and Pilot have also agreed to form the Cliff Head Wind and Solar Project Joint Venture (Wind & Solar JV) with Pilot owning 80% and Triangle 20%. The Wind & Solar JV will assess the feasibility of the development of an offshore wind and onshore wind and solar power project centred around the Cliff Head Offshore Oil Field production facilities, Cliff Head Alpha and the onshore Arrowsmith Separation and Processing Facilities.

WA-481-P is located immediately adjacent to, contiguous with and surrounds the offshore Cliff Head Oil Field. The field is located in the Perth Basin about 270 kilometres north of Perth and 12 kilometres off the coast of Dongara in Western Australia. Triangle is majority owner and operator of the Cliff Head Offshore Oil Field and the onshore Arrowsmith Separation and Processing Facilities. In September 2020 Pilot entered into an agreement to acquire Royal Energy Pty Ltd, which holds an effective 21.25% interest in the Cliff Head Oil Field. Triangle has agreed that Pilot’s share in any oil and gas discoveries in WA-481-P will be developed and produced through the Cliff Head Oil Field facilities and that Pilot will have access to these facilities on the same basis as Triangle.

Through the shared ownership of  WA-481-P and Cliff Head Oil Field synergies can be achieved. Many of the required feasibility studies for and offshore wind project can use historical data collected for oil and gas exploration and vice versa. For example historical wind speed measurements were taken from the Alpha Platform and further resource measurements could also be taken at a low cost by Pilot from the Platform.

The JV will undertake detailed assessment of the feasibility and pursue the development of an offshore wind farm and onshore solar project whilst integrating with the existing Cliff Head Oil Field offshore and onshore facilities and operations to allow for cost savings. The Cliff Head Alpha Platform will become multitasking as it will also act as an offshore substation.

The conceptual layout for the four stage 1.1 GW development includes up to 78 turbines, each with a 14 MW capacity.  The offshore wind turbines will be located at least 14 km offshore and in water depths of between 20-40 metres.

The cut-off date for the WA-481-P transaction to complete is 15 March 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Triangle Energy (78.75%), Pilot Energy Ltd.

Array cabling 33 or 66kV.
Up to 2 met masts across the 2 projects
Each of the three sites, MacColl, Stevenson and Telford, the maximum number of turbines for each site is 62, with 186 in total.

Development costs until the end of 2015 for Moray Firth are in the region of 70 million GBP, according to a EDP Renewables presentation given in July 2014.
Over the three projects the transmission infrastructure will consist of 2 AC offshore substations and up to 4 export cables.

It is not currently known which phase will construct first between Stevenson, Telford and MacColl and therefore an indicative installation programme has been included for the entire development.

The complete DEVEX spend up until the end of 2014 was £45 million for the Moray Firth Eastern Development.

The eastern site will be developed first and decisions on the western site will be made at a later date. Therefore the eastern projects will be submitted for consent separately to the western project. All eastern projects have submitted for consent at the same time.

Consequently it was decided that the Moray East site would be developed first. By 2016 it had become apparent that a number of the key constraints limiting development within the Moray West Site were starting to reduce e.g. the MoD Practice Area had been removed and plans to decommission the Beatrice Oil Field and associated infrastructure had been announced.

The FEP provides the framework for the spatial and temporal development of offshore wind farms in the North and Baltic Seas. It also defines how and when these areas should be connected to the onshore power grid.

The draft FEP includes plans for tenders for to be launched from 2021-2025 with commissioning from 2026-2030. Planned areas include N-3, N-6, N-7, N-9 and N-10, in the North Sea and O-1.3 in the Baltic Sea with a total targeted capacity of 9.688 GW. Timeline considers 1 GW to be tendered per year from 2021-2023, 3 GW in 2024 and 4 GW in 2025. The FEP also incorporates plans for post-2030 with areas in N-11, N-12 and N-13 totalling ~10 GW to be tendered after 2025 and built after 2030.

The FEP specifies standardised technology and planning principles for the associated connection systems. This includes the use of 66 kV direct connection between the turbine array and the converter platform which eliminates the need for a substation and intermediate 155 kV HVAC cables. From 2029 a new connection concept will also be used which includes 525 kV HVDC cables and transmission capacity of 2 GW per cable system. This will be more space efficient and reduce environmental impacts.

Compared to the representation in FEP 2019, areas N-9 to N-13 in this preliminary draft have been enlarged. In area N-9, four areas of approximately the same size are defined as part of this plan and two areas in N-10.  The entire area of N-10.2 is not fully required to meet 20 GW by 2030 target.

Areas N-4 are under review with a view to possible subsequent use but not included in currents plans due to conflicts of use. Area N-5, some sites considered for later expansion but generally less favourable. Particularly areas N-5.4 due to environmental and conservation issues. N-8 is considered spatially difficult and inefficient. Southern areas within O-1 have conflicts of use. Area O-2.2 is in question but has conflicts of use with shipping areas. The development of the open spaces in area O-6 could result in additional potential for post 2030. However, this is subject to the actual availability of the space.

Spatial descriptions of the converter platforms in areas N-3 to N-7 and the transformer platforms in areas O-1 and O-2  are unchanged. Compared to the FEP 2019, the platform NOR-3-2 was moved about 1.3 km to the north. It is now considered feasible and cost efficient to use 66 kV direct connection concept for N-6 as well based on further studies. A 66 kV development is also planned for area N-9. The converter platform NOR-9-1 is planned in the middle between the surfaces N-9.1 and N-9.2. The NOR- 9-2 converter platform opens up and is centered between the surfaces N-9.3 and N-9.4. In area N-10, a converter platform, NOR-10-1, is planned in the middle between N-10.1 and N-10.2. To connect areas in N-11 to N-13 after 2030 would require the construction of five additional offshore networks (NOR 12-1, NOR 12-2, NOR 11-1, NOR 11-2, NOR 13-1)

The draft FEP includes plans for tenders for to be launched from 2021-2025 with commissioning from 2026-2030. Planned areas include N-3, N-6, N-7, N-9 and N-10, in the North Sea and O-1.3 in the Baltic Sea with a total targeted capacity of 9.688 GW. Timeline considers 1 GW to be tendered per year from 2021-2023, 3 GW in 2024 and 4 GW in 2025. The FEP also incorporates plans for post-2030 with areas in N-11, N-12 and N-13 totalling ~10 GW to be tendered after 2025 and built after 2030.

The FEP specifies standardised technology and planning principles for the associated connection systems. This includes the use of 66 kV direct connection between the turbine array and the converter platform which eliminates the need for a substation and intermediate 155 kV HVAC cables. From 2029 a new connection concept will also be used which includes 525 kV HVDC cables and transmission capacity of 2 GW per cable system. This will be more space efficient and reduce environmental impacts.

Compared to the representation in FEP 2019, areas N-9 to N-13 in this preliminary draft have been enlarged. In area N-9, four areas of approximately the same size are defined as part of this plan and two areas in N-10.  The entire area of N-10.2 is not fully required to meet 20 GW by 2030 target.

Areas N-4 are under review with a view to possible subsequent use but not included in currents plans due to conflicts of use. Area N-5, some sites considered for later expansion but generally less favourable. Particularly areas N-5.4 due to environmental and conservation issues. N-8 is considered spatially difficult and inefficient. Southern areas within O-1 have conflicts of use. Area O-2.2 is in question but has conflicts of use with shipping areas. The development of the open spaces in area O-6 could result in additional potential for post 2030. However, this is subject to the actual availability of the space.

Spatial descriptions of the converter platforms in areas N-3 to N-7 and the transformer platforms in areas O-1 and O-2  are unchanged. Compared to the FEP 2019, the platform NOR-3-2 was moved about 1.3 km to the north. It is now considered feasible and cost efficient to use 66 kV direct connection concept for N-6 as well based on further studies. A 66 kV development is also planned for area N-9. The converter platform NOR-9-1 is planned in the middle between the surfaces N-9.1 and N-9.2. The NOR- 9-2 converter platform opens up and is centered between the surfaces N-9.3 and N-9.4. In area N-10, a converter platform, NOR-10-1, is planned in the middle between N-10.1 and N-10.2. To connect areas in N-11 to N-13 after 2030 would require the construction of five additional offshore networks (NOR 12-1, NOR 12-2, NOR 11-1, NOR 11-2, NOR 13-1)

For the first time, the BSH is also providing so-called other energy production areas for consultation in the preliminary draft submitted. In these areas, innovative forms of energy generation, for example for hydrogen production without connection to the public power grid, are to be tested. Two areas in zones 1 and 2 have also been reserved for other energy generation these include SEN-1 (approx. 28.8 km²) in zone 2 of north sea and SEO-1 (approx. 7.8 km²) in Baltic Sea. The other energy production area SEO-1 is under review due to possible usage conflicts with regard to nature conservation issues, especially bird migration.

DE2X,N-7.2,,Germany,Development Zone,German Central Tender 2022,Exclusive Economic Zone 2 (BorWin) (BSH Cluster 7),,,"19 Jun 2020: On 19th June the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) published the first update to its Area Development Plan (FEP) following the increase on offshore wind targets to 20 GW by 2030 and 50 GW by 2040. The FEP provides the framework for the spatial and temporal development of offshore wind farms in the North and Baltic Seas. It also defines how and when these areas should be connected to the onshore power grid.

The draft FEP includes plans for tenders for to be launched from 2021-2025 with commissioning from 2026-2030. Planned areas include N-3, N-6, N-7, N-9 and N-10, in the North Sea and O-1.3 in the Baltic Sea with a total targeted capacity of 9.688 GW. Timeline considers 1 GW to be tendered per year from 2021-2023, 3 GW in 2024 and 4 GW in 2025. The FEP also incorporates plans for post-2030 with areas in N-11, N-12 and N-13 totalling ~10 GW to be tendered after 2025 and built after 2030.

The FEP specifies standardised technology and planning principles for the associated connection systems. This includes the use of 66 kV direct connection between the turbine array and the converter platform which eliminates the need for a substation and intermediate 155 kV HVAC cables. From 2029 a new connection concept will also be used which includes 525 kV HVDC cables and transmission capacity of 2 GW per cable system. This will be more space efficient and reduce environmental impacts.

Compared to the representation in FEP 2019, areas N-9 to N-13 in this preliminary draft have been enlarged. In area N-9, four areas of approximately the same size are defined as part of this plan and two areas in N-10.  The entire area of N-10.2 is not fully required to meet 20 GW by 2030 target.

Areas N-4 are under review with a view to possible subsequent use but not included in currents plans due to conflicts of use. Area N-5, some sites considered for later expansion but generally less favourable. Particularly areas N-5.4 due to environmental and conservation issues. N-8 is considered spatially difficult and inefficient. Southern areas within O-1 have conflicts of use. Area O-2.2 is in question but has conflicts of use with shipping areas. The development of the open spaces in area O-6 could result in additional potential for post 2030. However, this is subject to the actual availability of the space.

Spatial descriptions of the converter platforms in areas N-3 to N-7 and the transformer platforms in areas O-1 and O-2  are unchanged. Compared to the FEP 2019, the platform NOR-3-2 was moved about 1.3 km to the north. It is now considered feasible and cost efficient to use 66 kV direct connection concept for N-6 as well based on further studies. A 66 kV development is also planned for area N-9. The converter platform NOR-9-1 is planned in the middle between the surfaces N-9.1 and N-9.2. The NOR- 9-2 converter platform opens up and is centered between the surfaces N-9.3 and N-9.4. In area N-10, a converter platform, NOR-10-1, is planned in the middle between N-10.1 and N-10.2. To connect areas in N-11 to N-13 after 2030 would require the construction of five additional offshore networks (NOR 12-1, NOR 12-2, NOR 11-1, NOR 11-2, NOR 13-1)

For the first time, the BSH is also providing so-called other energy production areas for consultation in the preliminary draft submitted. In these areas, innovative forms of energy generation, for example for hydrogen production without connection to the public power grid, are to be tested. Two areas in zones 1 and 2 have also been reserved for other energy generation these include SEN-1 (approx. 28.8 km²) in zone 2 of north sea and SEO-1 (approx. 7.8 km²) in Baltic Sea. The other energy production area SEO-1 is under review due to possible usage conflicts with regard to nature conservation issues, especially bird migration.

With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,Energimyndigheten,,,20430,16344,Not Decided,,,,,,,,4086,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,1,38,,35,,26.59,8.55,4085.69,58.3987,17.3556,Baltic and Kattegat,Europe,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also considered were cost and grid connection opportunities.
Five potential 12nm search areas were identified (see map) which were then cost modeled against locations within the EEZ. The study estimated that EUR 600m in subsidy savings were possible under assumptions of 2020 targets of 6GW.

The agreement includes plans for:
·	Establishment of two energy Islands by 2030; one at Bornholm at 2 GW and one in the North Sea at 3 GW. The North Sea Island will be expanded to 10 GW in the long term. The island in the North Sea is being expanded in phases as electricity consumption rises and the energy island joins trade links with other countries. The energy islands must not only produce electricity, but also in the long term be able to connect technologies that can store or convert the green power to green fuels (so-called ""Power-to-X""). It is a condition of the projects that they are profitable. Work on the energy islands will start immediately and parties involved will be continuously updated of the scheduling.
·	The establishment of the second wind farm agreed in the 2018 energy agreement will be located at Hesselø with a capacity of 1 GW. The parties have agreed that the wind farm should be operational by 2027 and have advanced the schedule compared to the original 2018 agreement.
·	The third wind farm agreed in the 2018 energy agreement will be included in the first phase of the energy islands and will be realised by 2030.
·	The funds reserved for the connection of second and third projects of the Energy Agreement 2018 will be re-prioritized to finance elements of the agreement.
·	The parties agree that DKK 4 million will be allocated in 2020, DKK 121 million in 2021 and DKK 89 million in 2022 for a preliminary study of the two energy islands and the park at Hesselø, at the same time with the re-prioritization of the funds allocated for preliminary studies of parks 2 and 3 of the Energy Agreement 2018. The preliminary studies are the first step in the establishment of the energy islands.
·	The energy islands and Hesselø must be based on the principles of the Energy Agreement 2018, which states that in future, offshore wind should be market-driven as far as possible without public support.
·	Other key points of the agreement include: promotion of Power-to-X plants and CO2 capture technology; electrification of the heating sector; Support for biogas and other green gases; Sustainability requirements for biomass for energy; Green restructuring of the industry; and Transition to market-driven expansion of solar cells and onshore wind. The so-called mill ceiling (maximum of 1,850 onshore wind turbines) will be postponed from 2030 to 2040 and CfD tenders for new onshore turbines and solar will be launched in 2020 and 2021.

The agreement includes plans for:
·	Establishment of two energy Islands by 2030; one at Bornholm at 2 GW and one in the North Sea at 3 GW. The North Sea Island will be expanded to 10 GW in the long term. The island in the North Sea is being expanded in phases as electricity consumption rises and the energy island joins trade links with other countries. The energy islands must not only produce electricity, but also in the long term be able to connect technologies that can store or convert the green power to green fuels (so-called ""Power-to-X""). It is a condition of the projects that they are profitable. Work on the energy islands will start immediately and parties involved will be continuously updated of the scheduling.
·	The establishment of the second wind farm agreed in the 2018 energy agreement will be located at Hesselø with a capacity of 1 GW. The parties have agreed that the wind farm should be operational by 2027 and have advanced the schedule compared to the original 2018 agreement.
·	The third wind farm agreed in the 2018 energy agreement will be included in the first phase of the energy islands and will be realised by 2030.
·	The funds reserved for the connection of second and third projects of the Energy Agreement 2018 will be re-prioritized to finance elements of the agreement.
·	The parties agree that DKK 4 million will be allocated in 2020, DKK 121 million in 2021 and DKK 89 million in 2022 for a preliminary study of the two energy islands and the park at Hesselø, at the same time with the re-prioritization of the funds allocated for preliminary studies of parks 2 and 3 of the Energy Agreement 2018. The preliminary studies are the first step in the establishment of the energy islands.
·	The energy islands and Hesselø must be based on the principles of the Energy Agreement 2018, which states that in future, offshore wind should be market-driven as far as possible without public support.
·	Other key points of the agreement include: promotion of Power-to-X plants and CO2 capture technology; electrification of the heating sector; Support for biogas and other green gases; Sustainability requirements for biomass for energy; Green restructuring of the industry; and Transition to market-driven expansion of solar cells and onshore wind.

Analysis by Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) estimates 1.2GW of wind is feasible in waters shallower than 20m, with a further 5GW in depths of 20m-50m. Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;
1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016
2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms
3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development
In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.
The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.
36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.
Strong fundamental forces are driving Taiwan's ambitions. Nuclear power is being phased out and high forest and mountain coverage is constraining onshore wind growth. High wind speeds, manageable distances to shore and water depth, plus strong political support with solid legal and financial institutions provide attractive conditions for investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,Taiwanese Government,Taiwanese government,,8,,Not Decided,,,,,,8,,1,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.73,,23.5956,119.7235,Formosa Strait,Asia,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,Rewind Offshore,,,400,,Not Decided,,,,,,,40,45,,,,Grounded: Rock-Anchored Concrete Rings,,Foundation consists of a stack of precast concrete rings placed on a level rock seafloor.

Following on from the 2017 allocation, 2679MW of connections are available in the North Sea and 785MW in the Baltic. Between these two seas a maximum of 1610MW will be auctioned (1550 plus the remaining 60MW from the 2017 auction), with a carveout of 500MW reserved for Baltic Sea projects. Therefore 1110MW remains for the North Sea.

Around 5.5GW of projects are available to compete, although it is not expected that all Baltic Sea projects will do so under their current ownership. The key driver for zero-bids outlined by both winners in the 2017 auction are a late delivery (2024 or greater) and the associated technological advances this brings, and economies of scale. Site conditions (assumed to mean wind speed) was also mentioned by
DONG. Considering these three factors – 2024 or greater delivery, economies of scale, and wind resource, a simple analysis of the remaining North Sea Projects is possible.

It is assumed that He Dreiht will not bid in 2018 having already won with a significant bid, and Gode Wind 03 will not bid for further capacity in the auction due to a high density of 27.4MW/m2 following the first auction. The allocation of 900MW to He Dreiht means there is no longer any available capacity in Cluster 7 and therefore Vattenfall’s Global Tech 2 and EnBW’s OWP Albatros (not to be confused with ENBW’s Albatros also known as Hohe See Extension) must also be excluded.

In June 2018 Trident Winds partnered with EnBW's regional subsidiary EnBW North America to develop the 650–1,000 MW Morro Bay project under the joint venture Castle Wind.  Castle Wind LLC is focusing on obtaining the site lease from BOEM for approximately 1,000 MW floating offshore wind project and is in the queue with California Independent System Operator for the grid connection at the Morro Bay substation.

Costs need to come down, offshore wind specific incentives need to be introduced, or an export market developed through collaboration with another EU member state - such ""joint projects"" are being pursued by Sweden and will require the establishment of an MoU similar to that under negotiation between UK and Ireland.",,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities.

In June the UK government proposed an exemption order for wind farm generators in tender rounds 5 and 6 of the offshore transmission owner (OFTO) regime, who have been affected by COVID-19 and are currently in the process of transferring assets between the wind farm developer and new OFTO company. in the UK developers/owners are allowed to own and operate the transmission systems for 18 months without a transmission license but after this ownership must be transferred to an OFTO company selected by Ofgem. Projects to be affected include Rampion, Beatrice, Hornsea One and East Anglia ONE offshore wind farms. The government considers that the Hornsea One, Rampion and Beatrice projects are likely to be unable to complete the transfer of transmission assets within the 18-month commissioning period and propose a 12 month extension. The government  also propose a three month extension for East Anglia ONE due to delays to the tender process and a likely knock on effect to the transfer of assets. A consultation on the proposal closes on 10th July.

Rampion has an existing exemption which expires on 27th November 2020 with the transmission assets due to be handed over to Transmission Capital Partners.

There were no problems with standing bights witnessed, as the I-trencher does not lift the cable too high and an overlap was included past the competent material, so the bight could be buried by jet trencher.The second replacement export cable (Cable 4) was buried using a wheel-cutter by Assodivers.

DK58,Sæby (Nearshore Tender Area),,Denmark,Development Zone,Nearshore Tender (DK) - Future Tender,Nordjylland,"As with open door projects, generators are to pay for the grid connection to shore. Costs of environmental and geotech studies, estimated at 10-15m kr will be initially borne by Energinet.dk through a network tariff. The costs for the preliminary investigations in the area won by the concessionaire will subsequently be refunded by the concessionaire.

The nearshore tender is seen as a way of increasing competition for site development in Denmark - the smaller scale and relatively easier construction environment should make sites more interesting for developers.
Constructors are obliged to offer 20% of projects to local citizens. Constructors who can demonstrate that at least 30% of the project is locally owned by enterprises and citizens will get a price supplement of DKK 0.01/kWh.

Total turbine height 135-220m. Max number of turbines is 67 if the capacity is 200MW and the turbines are 3MW.

Energinet.dk, who is responsible for conducting the preliminary surveys and the EIA, has made available their cost projection for this. The cost of the surveys at any site is to be paid by the concession winner of the site. Only the costs of those sites which will be used in this round, are to be paid.
The final costs will be published in the fall of 2015. The cost projection for this project is 23.3 mill DKK or 3.13 mill Euro.

Update 2014: As part of the Growth Pack 2014 (Vækstpakke 2014) proposals the overall capacity for this nearshore round was reduced from 450MW to 350MW. There was also a cap put on future bids of 0.70DKK per kWh for 50,000 full load hours. Relevant offers above this cap will be subject to political acceptance. The 50MW pilot projects were unaffected.

Update March 2015: A multisite tender will be issued. This means that 6 areas will be offered for tender at the same time and that projects within these sites will be competing against each other. The concession owner shall build and operate the wind farm and the export cable to the grid connection point on the shore. A tenderer is allowed to submit more than 1 tender.

Furthermore,conditional tendering for 2 sites will be possible, i.e. a tenderer can submit offers for up to 350 MW conditional upon the tenderer being awarded concession for both sites.

The DEA will award the concession(s) to the tenderer(s) who has submitted the offer(s) which make(s) it possible to obtain establishment of the highest total capacity within the maximum limit of 350 MW at the lowest total average price. The license and authorisation for operations will be given for 25 years with the possibility of prolongation if allowed under applicable law. The concession agreement(s) offer(s) a fixed price/kWh for 50 000 full load hours (contract for difference) which makes a very predictable income. The fixed price will not be indexed.

Following pre-qualification the DEA will invite a maximum of 10 applicants.
In order to ensure that only genuine, professional tenderes submit tenders, the DEA is introducing a penalty for defective performance of 100 000 000 DKK (EUR ~13.5m). The required guarantee will be released when a capex of DKK 300m has been spent or the first kWh has been delivered.
At least 20% ownership shares must be made available to local citizens.
Full compensation forloss of local residential value where greater than 1 per cent must be paid.

The concession agreements are subject to i) the Danish Parliament adopting the necessary amendment to the RE Act to accept the winning price and ii) EU state aid clearance",http://www.ens.dk/undergrund-forsyning/vedvarende-energi/vindkraft-vindmoller/havvindmoller/kystnaere-havmolleparker-1,"22 Dec 2016: Energi-, forsynings- og klima minister Lars Chr. Lilleholt has decided to maintain reservation on  the remaining Nearshore Tender sites, which were included in the 350 MW 2016 Tender.
Reservations will be maintained until there is  clarification of the need for additional  procurement of nearshore capacity.
Area reservations will mean that there can be no open door applications for the areas.
The areas will only be included in any tender of additional coastal wind farms if there is local support for a new tender in the area.

matures, or when existing use of the areas changes.

Consent for Seagreen Alpha and Seagreen Bravo OWFs and the Offshore Transmission Asset was awarded by Scottish Ministers in October 2014.The consents were confirmed in November 2017, following a legal challenge by the RSPB to the consent award decision.

In March 2018, SWEL applied for a consent variation to remove the 525MW generating limit for sites Alpha and Bravo so as to enable the installation of more powerful turbines and maximise the output to 1.5GW. This was approved on 28th August 2018.

In September 2018 SWEL submitted a separate application for an optimised Seagreen Project design and EIA report to take advantage of technological advances.

Costs of environmental and geotech studies, estimated at 10-15m kr will be initially borne by Energinet.dk through a network tariff. The costs for the preliminary investigations in the area won by the concessionaire will subsequently be refunded by the concessionaire.

The nearshore tender is seen as a way of increasing competition for site development in Denmark - the smaller scale and relatively easier construction environment should make sites more interesting for developers.
Constructors are obliged to offer 20% of projects to local citizens. Constructors who can demonstrate that at least 30% of the project is locally owned by enterprises and citizens will get a price supplement of DKK 0.01/kWh.

The cost of the surveys at any site is to be paid by the concession winner of the site. Only the costs of those sites which will be used in this round, are to be paid.

The phase one community consultation ran from 9 July until 20 August 2020; due to COVID-19 it was predominantly via virtual platforms. Early stage proposals were presented locally and online for feedback from the community and key stakeholders. There were over 1,700 visits to the virtual exhibition and almost 300 pieces of feedback were received during the consultation period.
A high-level overview of all the feedback received during the first consultation is presented in the summary report. 89% of respondents agreed that that the UK needs to generate more energy from renewable sources, including offshore wind generation. 48% of respondents either supported or strongly supported the Extension Projects. 34% either did not support or strongly opposed the Extension Projects, and 18% provided a neutral view. Important aspects of the project which were highligthed in the consultation were: traffic and access during construction; ecology, visual impacts, tourism, recreation, heritage and archaeology, and fishing. Feedback received will help refine proposals.
   A more detailed report, along with on-going surveys and technical investigations will be shared in the Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) for phase two of the community consultation. This second phase of community consultation will be held in Spring 2021.

Favonius has since been developing the 'Kattegat Offshore' project, after much investigation they have concluded that the site of 'Skottarevsprojektet' is the best location for 'Kattegat Offshore'.",http://www.favonius.se,"31 Jan 2017: Swedish Offshore Wind - National Strategy Update
With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,,07-Dec-2007,,,,,,,,AGRIVIND,Favonius AB,,150,,Not Decided,,,,,,5,,30,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,Jackets or Monopiles,,,,,,,,,22,30,,,9.47,9.22,8.84,17.18,56.8244,12.3462,Kattegat,Europe,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,32.01,Nearest candidate grid connection point chosen,

DK63,Smålandsfarvandet (Nearshore Tender Area),,Denmark,Development Zone,Nearshore Tender (DK) - Future Tender,Sjælland,"As with open door projects, generators are to pay for the grid connection to shore. Costs of environmental and geotech studies, estimated at 10-15m kr will be initially borne by Energinet.dk through a network tariff. The costs for the preliminary investigations in the area won by the concessionaire will subsequently be refunded by the concessionaire.

The nearshore tender is seen as a way of increasing competition for site development in Denmark - the smaller scale and relatively easier construction environment should make sites more interesting for developers.
Constructors are obliged to offer 20% of projects to local citizens. Constructors who can demonstrate that at least 30% of the project is locally owned by enterprises and citizens will get a price supplement of DKK 0.01/kWh.
If the project capacity goes as high as 200MW there could be 67 turbines.

Total turbine height 135-220m. Max number of turbines is 67 if the capacity is 200MW and the turbines are 3MW.

Energinet.dk, who is responsible for conducting the preliminary surveys and the EIA, has made available their cost projection for this. The cost of the surveys at any site is to be paid by the concession winner of the site. Only the costs of those sites which will be used in this round, are to be paid.
The final costs will be published in the fall of 2015. The cost projection for this project is 25.6 mill DKK or 3.44 mill Euro.",http://www.ens.dk/undergrund-forsyning/vedvarende-energi/vindkraft-vindmoller/havvindmoller/kystnaere-havmolleparker-4,"22 Dec 2016: Energi-, forsynings- og klima minister Lars Chr.

Category A: Wind power development within the zone

Category B: Wind power development within the zone will
have challenges related to either technical aspects or conflict of interests/negative impacts. The challenges might
be resolved in the future through technology development,

that zones in this category can be opened when technology
matures, or when existing use of the areas changes.

Category A: Wind power development within the zone
is technically and economically feasible, and will have
relatively few negative impacts. Grid connection is possible
before 2025.

Category B: Wind power development within the zone will
have challenges related to either technical aspects or conflict of interests/negative impacts. The challenges might
be resolved in the future through technology development,
grid measures and/or mitigation measures. NVE considers
that zones in this category can be opened when technology
matures, or when existing use of the areas changes.

Category C: Wind power development within the zone represents greater challenges than in the other two categories.
Conflicts of interest in the areas are not easily resolved.
Foreseen negative impacts are still considered acceptable. Zones in this category should not be opened at the

With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The findings, published in 2017 concluded that sector-specific support for offshore wind in addition to the current certificate system is both uneconomical and unnecessary given available alternative renewable resources.",,,01-Jan-2012,,,,,,,,,Solid Vind,Solid Vind AB,,,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,66,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,6.6,20,,,,48.83,8.99,62.63,59.5668,19.87,Baltic Sea,Europe,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis by Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) estimates 1.2GW of wind is feasible in waters shallower than 20m, with a further 5GW in depths of 20m-50m. Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;
1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016
2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms
3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development
In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.
The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.
36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.

NO42,Træna vest,Offshore wind - study area; Category B,Norway,Development Zone,,Nordland,"In 2013, NVE divided considered offshore wind zones into three categories. Traena Vest is considered Category B.

Category A: Wind power development within the zone
is technically and economically feasible, and will have
relatively few negative impacts. Grid connection is possible
before 2025.

Category B: Wind power development within the zone will
have challenges related to either technical aspects or conflict of interests/negative impacts. The challenges might
be resolved in the future through technology development,
grid measures and/or mitigation measures. NVE considers
that zones in this category can be opened when technology
matures, or when existing use of the areas changes.

Category C: Wind power development within the zone represents greater challenges than in the other two categories.
Conflicts of interest in the areas are not easily resolved.
Foreseen negative impacts are still considered acceptable. Zones in this category should not be opened at the
expense of zones in the two other categories.",,"30 Nov 2020: On 26th August 2020, the OED sent a letter to NVE requesting NVE to undertake an assessment to verify if significant changes have taken place since the 2012 report, in order to consider reclassification from a B Category to an A Category (these categories control priority of opening up areas for development). They also asked NVE to consider alternative demarcations. NVE concludes that there is no basis for the category change, and the area may now be less suitable for development.
On 30th November, NVE published a report detailing its decision: NVE does not approve of changing the classification but does recommend investigation into splitting Traenafjorden-Selvaer into two areas.
Broadly, it's considerations included:
Changes to seabird populations: Since 2012 there has been a decline in seabird populations, and therefore more input from the Environmental Agency is required to identify potential impacts of development in the areas.
Shipping Traffic: increase since 2012, expected to continue increasing.
Overlap with petroleum activities: Traena Vest extends 1.5 km into an area that in 2019 was opened for petroleum activities, and a decision will be taken on whether drilling will go ahead in March 2022. Clarification on petroleum activity is required before the area could be opened, potentially conflict can be resolved via amending the area boundary.
Technological advancements: As the market has evolved since 2012 (e.g. offshore accommodation platforms are not indsustry standard as previously predicted), new market assumptions affect profitability assessments but do not make a significant difference to ranking of areas.
Electricity price:NVE highlights that Traena Vest and Traenafjorden-Selvaer are in electricity area NO4, which has the lowest electricity prices.
Stattnet provides input on grid availability: line upgrades have been made with future planned, but installed capacity in Norway and northern Sweden has also increased since 2012.

Summary Traena Vest: The Norwegian Coastal Administration considers that high ship traffic means the area is unsuitable, but risks could be mitigated by amending the area boundary.

The EPQ includes questionnaire and bidders will be evaluated based on suitability, financial standing, technical and professional ability, limitation criteria etc. The outcome of this stage will be a shortlist of qualifying bidders, up to a maximum of 8, who will be invited to participate in the ITT Stage. At the ITT Stage, shortlisted qualifying bidders will be granted access to the data room which will include sufficient information to enable bidders to make an informed investment decision. During the ITT Stage, Ofgem will evaluate the tenders submitted by each shortlisted qualifying bidder. It will evaluate tenders against a set of evaluation criteria e.g. financial and non-financial deliverability. The outcome of this stage will either be selection of a preferred bidder (and possibly also a reserve bidder) for each Qualifying Project, or a decision to run a Best and Final Offer stage. After the preferred bidder is selected, the preferred bidder and the relevant developer will work together to finalise arrangements for transfer of the transmission assets from the developer to the licenced OFTO. Once arrangements are finalized, there will be a 28-day public consultation on the proposed modifications to the OFTO licence in order to incorporate the OFTO-specific provisions in the licence. Following the consultation the OFTO licence can be granted. Winning bidders will own and operate transmission assets including offshore platforms, subsea cables and onshore infrastructure. Bidders will be awarded an OFTO licence entitling it to a revenue stream for a 25-year period.

The EPQ phase commenced (tender documents available) 30th November. EPQ bid submission deadline is 5th February 2021. ITT shortlists will be announced 19th April 2021.

EE12,Tuuletraal,,Estonia,Concept/Early Planning,,Saare,"Minimum 350 MW wind farm (by government regulation), with permission to use up to 76 turbines.
Plans originally foresaw mixed use of Nenuphar twinfloat VA turbines (2.5 MW) with mussel farming.
Updated plans (2020) see fixed foundation turbines of 14-18 MW: the wind farm is the only current project behind the 25 km visibility buffer line for 250-300m high turbines. Updated plans envisage up to 3 phases of 350 MW. The first phase would connect via AC cable and provide opportunity to monitor environmental impacts. As hydrogen concepts mature, later phases may include a pipeline or electrolyser.

The project has synergy both with aquaculture (est production of 50,000t mussels/year) and potential for hydrogen. Initial studies will evaluate generation offshore or onshore, with options of a pipeline to the transmission network, conversion to ammonia-marine fuel, rail transport with the restoration of the former Virtsu railway, land transport and re-conversion to electricity.

Project finance:
Developers do not expect to require renewable energy subsidy.
The project is subject to a building fee of up to 1 m EUR (depending on capacity), and developers have suggested a fee of 1-2 m EUR/year paid to joint air monitoring system BALTNET, to compensate for impact on radar.
Developers are seeking to involve one of the world's TOP10 offshore wind energy companies from a NATO member state in the ownership.

The request to begin the building permit (and EIA) procedure was submitted to the government in 2017, for a windfarm of 76 turbines, one substation and cables (including potential for HVDC connection to the Baltic supergrid). Building permit process initiation was approved late in 2019.

Statistical wind parameters: 9.57 @150m, 9.75@200m",,"23 Sep 2020: Developers have submitted a draft Environmental Impact Assessment Programme for approval.
The draft EIA sets out a drastically different wind farm description to previous plans, foreseeing up to 75 x 14-18 MW fixed turbines, with variants of 1-3 x 350 MW layout. 350 MW is a minimum imposed by the government, with additional phases potentially incorporating hydrogen technology. Due to potential radar influence, developers have proposed payment of 1-2 million euros every year to defence agencies in order to support joint air monitoring system BALTNET.
The developer was considering interconnection with Latvia (which would have required a transboundary EIA) but has abandoned this plan due to a.) Gulf of Riga fisheries do not want additional impact on fish migration b.) developers suggestions were not incorporated in the Marine Spatial Plan c.) the Estonian and Latvian Ministries of Economy are currently approving a protocol of common intentions and would compete with private companies in the construction of a wind farm and connection cables in the Gulf of Riga.
Included in the EIA Programme is the intention for a feasibility study on hydrogen production, from the offshore substation and / or onshore substation and an electricity and / or hydrogen transmission system up to the onshore connection point (s). The study will investigate the pipeline to the transmission network, conversion to ammonia-marine fuel, rail transport with the restoration of the former Virtsu railway, land transport and re-conversion to electricity.

DK0U,Vest Nordsøen II + III - Screened Area - Island Connection,,Denmark,Development Zone,,Midtjylland,,,"22 Jun 2020: The government and a broad majority in the Folketing signed an agreement on an ambitious climate plan on 22nd June. The agreement, together with the agreement on a green waste sector, forms the first part of the government's overall climate action plan.
The agreement includes plans for:
·	Establishment of two energy Islands by 2030; one at Bornholm at 2 GW and one in the North Sea at 3 GW. The North Sea Island will be expanded to 10 GW in the long term. The island in the North Sea is being expanded in phases as electricity consumption rises and the energy island joins trade links with other countries. The energy islands must not only produce electricity, but also in the long term be able to connect technologies that can store or convert the green power to green fuels (so-called ""Power-to-X""). It is a condition of the projects that they are profitable. Work on the energy islands will start immediately and parties involved will be continuously updated of the scheduling.
·	The establishment of the second wind farm agreed in the 2018 energy agreement will be located at Hesselø with a capacity of 1 GW. The parties have agreed that the wind farm should be operational by 2027 and have advanced the schedule compared to the original 2018 agreement.
·	The third wind farm agreed in the 2018 energy agreement will be included in the first phase of the energy islands and will be realised by 2030.
·	The funds reserved for the connection of second and third projects of the Energy Agreement 2018 will be re-prioritized to finance elements of the agreement.
·	The parties agree that DKK 4 million will be allocated in 2020, DKK 121 million in 2021 and DKK 89 million in 2022 for a preliminary study of the two energy islands and the park at Hesselø, at the same time with the re-prioritization of the funds allocated for preliminary studies of parks 2 and 3 of the Energy Agreement 2018. The preliminary studies are the first step in the establishment of the energy islands.
·	The energy islands and Hesselø must be based on the principles of the Energy Agreement 2018, which states that in future, offshore wind should be market-driven as far as possible without public support.
·	Other key points of the agreement include: promotion of Power-to-X plants and CO2 capture technology; electrification of the heating sector; Support for biogas and other green gases; Sustainability requirements for biomass for energy; Green restructuring of the industry; and Transition to market-driven expansion of solar cells and onshore wind. The so-called mill ceiling (maximum of 1,850 onshore wind turbines) will be postponed from 2030 to 2040 and CfD tenders for new onshore turbines and solar will be launched in 2020 and 2021. In total, the agreement between the government and the Left, DF, Radical Left, SF, the Unity List, Conservatives, Liberal Alliance and the Alternative, together with the climate agreement for waste, results in CO2e reductions of DKK 3.4 million tonnes by 2030.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,28,58,,,,136.19,10.28,4196.69,56.2199,5.9179,North Sea,Europe,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to appeals against the project, the Danish Energy Board revoked parts of the permits relating to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Syd site in December 2018 and requested a supplemental EIA on the specific project design. Due to the similarities between the Nord and Syd sites, Vattenfall also requested that the Danish Energy Agency review the EIA process for the Vesterhav Nord project. Due to the additional EIA process,lVattenfall was granted a three-year extension to the commissioning deadline, now 2023.

The site consists of two areas Nord and Syd. Nord is located within 58.1 km2 study area located approx. 4 to 10 km from the coast west of Harboøre. Total capacity of up to 180 +/- 5 MW. Syd is located 46.4 km2 study area located approx. 4 to 10 km from the coast at Ringkøbing Fjord. The water depth in the area is between 15 and 25 meters.

It requires that a timely complaint is submitted no later than 11 January 2021 in accordance with the Danish Energy Agency's complaint guidelines and in the complaint draws attention to the fact that supplementary material will be submitted subsequently. The House of Boards states that this must be done as soon as possible.

Update 14th December 2020: The Danish Energy Agency's decided to resume the establishment permits for Vesterhav Syd & Nord. Vattenfall now has permission to start establishing the project, pending an initial appeal period. The permit may not be used until the appeal deadline has expired. An appeal against the decision does not have a suspensive effect, unless the Energy Appeals Board decides otherwise. This 2020 decision consists of a permit for the establishment of the electricity production plant Vesterhav Syd with
associated internal pipeline systems. Establishment and operation shall take place within the framework of the environmental impact report of May 2020.

Among the biggest initiatives is a completely new installation design for the two offshore wind farms that maximises the turbines' distance to the coast within the area designated by the Danish state.  For Vesterhav Syd this means that the turbines will be located around nine kilometres off the coast. For Vesterhav Nord, the northernmost turbine will be moving from its originally planned location to about eight kilometres off the coast.  Vattenfall will install a radar system that allows the light markings on the turbines to be significantly dimmed at night, pending approval from the Danish Transport, Construction and Housing Authority by the end of Q2 2021.


update 28/10/2020: The Danish Energy Agency is currently processing the consultation responses regarding the environmental impact report for the offshore wind farm. The DEA expect to be able to publish the decision by the end of November 2020.

The DEA expect to make its final decision on permits and EIA aproval in September/October 2020.

The Danish Energy Agency has been instructed by the Energy Board to prepare an updated EIA supplement which reflects the current wind farm design proposed by Vattenfall.  Due to the similarities between the Nord and Syd sites, Vattenfall also requested the Danish Energy Agency to review the EIA process for the Vesterhav Nord project. A final investment decision, was expected during the last quarter of 2018 alongside the Kriegers Flak project but has been delayed until the EIA review is completed. On 29th March 2019 Vattenfall announced that it has requested the Danish Energy Agency to delay the deadline for commissioning of the Vesterhav Nord & Syd projects from 2020 to 2023. Vattenfall has stated that due to the delay, changes in conditions and potential redesign of the projects the original construction and installation contracts of the main components (foundations, transition pieces and array cables as well as installation of turbines) have been cancelled and will be retendered at a later date.

With no sector specific support, offshore wind projects in Sweden have marginal economics at best and must compete with other renewables in a green certificate mechanism.

In August 2015 the Energy Agency, on behalf of the government, investigated what options were available for subsidising offshore wind should they decide to do so. A tender process similar to other European countries was proposed as being the most cost effective whilst also complying with EU State aid rules. Furthermore they suggested that, because of planning lead times, large scale projects under any such tender system would not see commissioning before 2024. The report advised that under such a scheme an expansion of offshore wind power of between 2250MW to 4500MW was credible by 2030. It was proposed that an earlier 'pilot tender' of 120MW could be operational by 2018.

However, with ample sites onshore along the southern coast the justification for supporting offshore wind has been questioned by many industry participants. The TSO, Svenska Kraftnat, in its 2016-2025 network development plan envisages no growth in offshore wind over the period, citing the economic challenges, and choosing not to investigate the implications of offshore wind grid penetration further.

There is some hope for advocates of offshore wind. In January 2016 the Energy Agency were once again charged with an investigative report, this time to analyse the potential for technology development and cost reduction of offshore wind over the next 15-25 years. The report, which will also address floating wind will consider the potential market size nationally and globally; an economic analysis ; energy and climate policy; innovation, business development, job creation, regional growth and export opportunities. The reported is to be delivered on 31 January 2017.",,,01-Jan-2011,,,,,,,,,Cloudberry (25%),Rewind Vänern AB,,22.5,,Not Decided,,,,,3,4.5,2,5,,,,Grounded: Rock-Anchored Concrete Rings,,Foundation consists of a stack of precast concrete rings placed on a level rock seafloor.

EOLFI (acquired by Shell) has planned to develop 2GW floating wind farms in Taiwan with a target of 1GW fully-commissioned by 2030. However, 4C estimated this is unlikely considering the strict localization requirements and limited local capabilities. Besides, EOLFI has not gained development experiences in Taiwan and has not passed any local reviews. This project might be realized after the third stage of ‘Block Development (2026-2030)’ unless the government in Taiwan determined to apply floating within next ten years. It is also understood that floating wind will be required to achieve the 2035 target, therefore a small-scale project might start offshore construction in early 2030s with a second one towards the mid-2030s.","Grupo COBRA (51%), Shell (49%)",EOLFI Greater China (歐風能源 股份有限公司),,500,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,,,,,Floating: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,30,45,,,,13.62,12.02,97.52,24.1575,120.2769,Taiwan Strait,Asia,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- pre-commercial 25MW stage of 3-4 turbines,

 - commercial stage of approximately 30 turbines producing 150MW",http://www.principlepowerinc.com/en/windfloat,"28 Sep 2016: Principle Power announces the successful completion of the project. At an event held in conjunction with the WindEurope Summit in Hamburg, Principle Power announced the successful decommissioning of WindFloat 1.  The project, originally installed in 2011, was a full lifecycle demonstration of the features and benefits of the WindFloat floating offshore wind foundation concept, and featured a Vestas V-80 2MW turbine.
Fabricated using the local supply chain and fully assembled and commissioned ashore, the WindFloat was then towed 400km to its project site, where it ultimately delivered over 17 GWh of energy to the grid and successfully operated through waves that at times exceeded 17m and winds of over 60 knots.
In July 2016, having completed all of its project objectives, Principle Power initiated the WindFloat decommissioning process.  The WindFloat foundation was detached from its mooring lines and electrical cable, and then towed back to Southern Portugal’s Port Sines facility, where the wind turbine was dissembled.  This was the first time an offshore wind turbine had been dismounted from a floating structure and it demonstrated the procedures to be used in commercial projects in the event of unanticipated major component failure.  The turbine has now been transferred to another project and the inspections reveal that the WindFloat foundation itself is in excellent condition.
“The WindFloat’s very successful 5-year deployment, in the open ocean of the Atlantic, has proven that the technology can meet its promise and is ready for commercialization,” said Joao Metelo, Principle Power’s President and CEO.  “The simplified assembly and installation, in addition to the ability to tow the unit to shore in the event of major maintenance issues, represents a sea-change in the way offshore wind can be done.  The WindFloat reduces risk, and cost, for deep or transitional depth offshore wind projects.”
Principle Power is now completing design for the WindFloat Atlantic project, a 25 MW project planned for deployment off of Northern Portugal which is backed by a consortium of major energy and industrial players including: EDP Renewables, Trust Wind (a 50/50 JV between
Engie and Marubeni), Chiyoda Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and Repsol.",10-Jan-2011,10-Jan-2011,,,01-Sep-2010,20-Dec-2011,31-Dec-2011,2011,2,High,,"EDP, Principle Power, A.

Analysis by Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) estimates 1.2GW of wind is feasible in waters shallower than 20m, with a further 5GW in depths of 20m-50m. Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;
1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016
2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms
3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development
In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.
The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.
36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.
Strong fundamental forces are driving Taiwan's ambitions. Nuclear power is being phased out and high forest and mountain coverage is constraining onshore wind growth. High wind speeds, manageable distances to shore and water depth, plus strong political support with solid legal and financial institutions provide attractive conditions for investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,Taiwan Generations,Taiwan Generations Corporation (永傳能源股份有限公司),,,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12.02,,24.1528,120.2345,Taiwan Strait,Asia,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis by Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) estimates 1.2GW of wind is feasible in waters shallower than 20m, with a further 5GW in depths of 20m-50m. Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;
1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016
2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms
3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development
In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.
The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.
36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.

Supervised by the Bureau of Energy, Taiwan's Thousand Wind Turbine programme is a 3-phased approach to realising this potential via;
1. A short-term target of 4 demonstration offshore wind turbines by 2016
2. A mid-term target of 520MW by 2020 achieved through three demonstration wind farms
3. A long-term target of 3000MW by 2025 achieved through zonal development
In this nascent market, supply constraints are likely to be a challenge to delivering the required compound annual growth rate of installations of around 100%. Additionally, typical project development times of 6-9 years means some capacity will likely be delivered later.
The 2009 Renewable Energy Development act supports annually reviewed feed-in tariffs available as either NT$5.7405(€15.6c)/kWh for 20 years or NT$7.1085(€19.3c)/kWh for the first 10 years followed by NT$3.4586(€9.4c)/kWh for the next 10 years.
36 ""Zones of Potential"" off the shallower (<50m), resource endowed west coast were identified in July 2015 and are currently being investigated by applicants with the aim of obtaining EIA approval during 2017 for projects in excess of 100MW per zone.
A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been completed and approved by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in July 2016. The SEA, which will be used to identify sites for commercial scale wind farms, recognises the need to protect the critically-endangered white dolphin found in the shallow waters of the west coast. The capacity of the zones will be adjusted in accordance with the SEA findings. From 2017 zones will be announced for development, with up to 500-2000MW released every three years and awarded based on qualitative criteria including paid-in capital and financial conditions; consortium composition and capabilities; schedule of development and domestic supply chain benefits.

The two-phase study started with a spatial investigation of potential locations after accounting for constraints relating to ports, shipping routes, sediments and environmentally sensitive areas. Also considered were cost and grid connection opportunities.
Five potential 12nm search areas were identified (see map) which were then cost modeled against locations within the EEZ. The study estimated that EUR 600m in subsidy savings were possible under assumptions of 2020 targets of 6GW. Next steps include more detailed spatial screening and cost modeling plus consultation before deciding whether development within the 12nm area can form part of the government’s ‘Structural Vision for Offshore Wind Energy’.",http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/duurzame-energie/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2013/06/27/quickscan-haalbaarheidsstudie-windparken-binnen-12-mijlszone.html,"26 Sep 2014: In September 2014 the government announced that this area was too small to be developed economically (insufficient for a 700MW platform) and would not be pursued further.

The two-phase study started with a spatial investigation of potential locations after accounting for constraints relating to ports, shipping routes, sediments and environmentally sensitive areas. Also considered were cost and grid connection opportunities.
Five potential 12nm search areas were identified (see map) which were then cost modeled against locations within the EEZ. The study estimated that EUR 600m in subsidy savings were possible under assumptions of 2020 targets of 6GW. Next steps include more detailed spatial screening and cost modeling plus consultation before deciding whether development within the 12nm area can form part of the government’s ‘Structural Vision for Offshore Wind Energy’.",http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/duurzame-energie/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2013/06/27/quickscan-haalbaarheidsstudie-windparken-binnen-12-mijlszone.html,"01 Dec 2014: Geophysical and geotechnical soil investigations started, in support of tender zones, maximum length of investigation will be 5 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Ministerie van Economische Zaken,,,,Not Decided,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded: Not Specified,,,,,,,,,,,11.6,21.5,,,,13.21,10.02,272.38,52.3347,4.2886,North Sea,Europe,NO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
